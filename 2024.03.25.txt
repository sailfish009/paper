84, TITLE: Point-DETR3D: Leveraging Imagery Data with Spatial Point Prior for Weakly Semi-supervised 3D Object Detection
AUTHORS: HONGZHI GAO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Therefore, the form of point annotations is proposed to offer significant prospects for practical applications in 3D detection, which is not only more accessible and less expensive but also provides strong spatial information for object localization.In this paper, we empirically discover that it is non-trivial to merely adapt Point-DETR to its 3D form, encountering two main bottlenecks: 1) it fails to encode strong 3D prior into the model, and 2) it generates low-quality pseudo labels in distant regions due to the extreme sparsity of LiDAR points. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Point-DETR3D, a teacher-student framework for weakly semi-supervised 3D detection, designed to fully capitalize on point-wise supervision within a constrained instance-wise annotation budget.Different from Point-DETR which encodes 3D positional information solely through a point encoder, we propose an explicit positional query initialization strategy to enhance the positional prior.

162, TITLE: A Technological Perspective on Misuse of Available AI
AUTHORS: Lukas P�hler ; Valentin Schrader ; Alexander Ladwein ; Florian von Keller
CATEGORY: cs.CY [cs.CY, cs.AI]

163, TITLE: KTbench: A Novel Data Leakage-Free Framework for Knowledge Tracing
AUTHORS: Yahya Badran ; Christine Preisach
CATEGORY: cs.CY [cs.CY, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: The second problem is that the available benchmark implementations ignore accounting for changes in sequence length when expanding KCs, leading to different models being tested with varying sequence lengths but still compared against the same benchmark. To address these problems, we introduce a general masking framework that mitigates the first problem and enhances the performance of such KT models while preserving the original model architecture without significant alterations.

166, TITLE: Bilateral Unsymmetrical Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation
AUTHORS: JIAHENG YU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.IR [cs.IR, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, they ignore that the difference relation density of nodes between the user- and item-side causes the adaptability of graphs on bilateral nodes to be different after multi-hop graph interaction calculation, which limits existing models to achieve ideal results. To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework for recommendation tasks called Bilateral Unsymmetrical Graph Contrastive Learning (BusGCL) that consider the bilateral unsymmetry on user-item node relation density for sliced user and item graph reasoning better with bilateral slicing contrastive training.

CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.SY, eess.SY]
HIGHLIGHT: We implemented two methods to improve the trained models for wastewater treatment data, which resulted in more accurate simulators: 1- Using the model's prediction data as input in the training step as a tool of correction, and 2- Change in the loss function to consider the long-term predicted shape (dynamics).

174, TITLE: Fat API Bindings of C++ Objects Into Scripting Languages
AUTHORS: Russell K. Standish
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, 68-04, D.3.4]
HIGHLIGHT: This can be contrasted with a conventional, or thin API, where the API is defined up front, and the C++ object provides the implementation, most of which is private to the C++ layer. Obviously, reflection is required to expose C++ objects to a consuming layer like this -- this paper explores using the Classdesc system to implement reflection of C++ objects into a JavaScript/TypeScript environment via a RESTservice, and also via a Node.js API module.

177, TITLE: Brain-grounding of Semantic Vectors Improves Neural Decoding of Visual Stimuli
AUTHORS: Shirin Vafaei ; Ryohei Fukuma ; Huixiang Yang ; Haruhiko Kishima ; Takufumi Yanagisawa
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: These vectors, hereafter referred as pretrained feature vectors, are usually derived from semantic spaces based solely on image and/or text features and therefore they might have a totally different characteristics than how visual stimuli is represented in the human brain, resulting in limiting the capability of brain decoders to learn this mapping. To address this issue, we propose a representation learning framework, termed brain-grounding of semantic vectors, which fine-tunes pretrained feature vectors to better align with the neural representation of visual stimuli in the human brain.
