CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.DB]
HIGHLIGHT: Prior query routing approaches generate only one response from the selectedmodel and a single response from a small (inexpensive) model was often not goodenough to beat a response from a large (expensive) model due to which they endup overusing the large model and missing out on potential cost savings.However, it is well known that for small models, generating multiple responsesand selecting the best can enhance quality while remaining cheaper than asingle large-model response. We leverage this idea to propose BEST-Route, anovel routing framework that chooses a model and the number of responses tosample from it based on query difficulty and the quality thresholds.Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method reduces costs byup to 60% with less than 1% performance drop.

AUTHORS: YU HAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is afundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception.A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds andstructured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings.Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds andimages, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separateencoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, oftenrequiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce thedetector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR andcamera views.

HIGHLIGHT: While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group RelativePolicy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failuremode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoningtrace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce alistener-augmented GRPO framework.

312, TITLE: Instant GaussianImage: A Generalizable and Self-Adaptive Image Representation Via 2D Gaussian Splatting
AUTHORS: Zhaojie Zeng ; Yuesong Wang ; Chao Yang ; Tao Guan ; Lili Ju

HIGHLIGHT: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has demonstrated remarkable advances inthe field of image representation but demands substantial GPU resources.GaussianImage recently pioneered the use of Gaussian Splatting to mitigate thiscost, however, the slow training process limits its practicality, and the fixednumber of Gaussians per image limits its adaptability to varying informationentropy. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a generalizable andself-adaptive image representation framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting.Our method employs a network to quickly generate a coarse Gaussianrepresentation, followed by minimal fine-tuning steps, achieving comparablerendering quality of GaussianImage while significantly reducing training time.Moreover, our approach dynamically adjusts the number of Gaussian points basedon image complexity to further enhance flexibility and efficiency in practice.Experiments on DIV2K and Kodak datasets show that our method matches or exceedsGaussianImage's rendering performance with far fewer iterations and shortertraining times.
