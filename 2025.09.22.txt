CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However,given the limited context size of LLMs, a fundamental question arises: Whichexamples should be selected to maximize performance on a given user query?While nearest-neighbor-based methods like KATE have been widely adopted forthis purpose, they suffer from well-known drawbacks in high-dimensionalembedding spaces, including poor generalization and a lack of diversity. Inthis work, we study this problem of example selection in ICL from a principled,information theory-driven perspective.

To address this, we propose a non-uniform pruning strategy, dubbed\textbf{Di}fferentiable \textbf{E}xpert \textbf{P}runing (\textbf{DiEP}), whichadaptively adjusts pruning rates at the layer level while jointly learninginter-layer importance, effectively capturing the varying redundancy acrossdifferent MoE layers.

In this work, we challeng this static paradigm by introducing aframework for dynamic CFG scheduling.

In this paper we show results for 5x5 lattice and compare them toprevious AI topology-oriented models and classical methods, showing that theyoutperform classical heuristics, and match previous specialized AI models, andperforms synthesis even for topologies that were not seen during training.

239, TITLE: Efficient Long-Tail Learning in Latent Space By Sampling Synthetic Data
AUTHORS: Nakul Sharma
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: With the rise of foundation models, recent researchhas focused on the full, partial, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of thesemodels to deal with long-tail classification. Despite the impressiveperformance of these works on the benchmark datasets, they still fail to closethe gap with the networks trained using the balanced datasets and still requiresubstantial computational resources, even for relatively smaller datasets.Underscoring the importance of computational efficiency and simplicity, in thiswork we propose a novel framework that leverages the rich semantic latent spaceof Vision Foundation Models to generate synthetic data and train a simplelinear classifier using a mixture of real and synthetic data for long-tailclassification.
