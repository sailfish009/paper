To address these limitations, we propose SMAAT, a new AT algorithm that leverages the manifold conjecture, stating that off-manifold AEs lead to better robustness while on-manifold AEs result in better generalization.

We propose a new data-dependent scaling law for LM's that accounts for the training data's gzip-compressibility; its compute-optimal frontier increases in dataset size preference (over parameter count preference) as training data becomes harder to compress.

AUTHORS: Antonio E. Porreca

HIGHLIGHT: Many unconventional computing models, including some that appear to be quite different from traditional ones such as Turing machines, happen to characterise either the complexity class P or PSPACE when working in deterministic polynomial time (and in the maximally parallel way, where this applies). We discuss variants of cellular automata and membrane systems that escape this dichotomy and characterise intermediate complexity classes, usually defined in terms of Turing machines with oracles, as well as some possible reasons why this happens.

475, TITLE: Unraveling The Smoothness Properties of Diffusion Models: A Gaussian Mixture Perspective
AUTHORS: Jiuxiang Gu ; Yingyu Liang ; Zhenmei Shi ; Zhao Song ; Yufa Zhou

HIGHLIGHT: However, a theoretical understanding of the Lipschitz continuity and second momentum properties of the diffusion process is still lacking. In this paper, we bridge this gap by providing a detailed examination of these smoothness properties for the case where the target data distribution is a mixture of Gaussians, which serves as a universal approximator for smooth densities such as image data.

AUTHORS: Shraddha Barke ; Emmanuel Anaya Gonzalez ; Saketh Ram Kasibatla ; Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick ; Nadia Polikarpova
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Unfortunately, purely neural approaches, such as large language models (LLMs), often fail to produce fully correct programs in unfamiliar DSLs, while purely symbolic methods based on combinatorial search scale poorly to complex problems. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce a hybrid approach, where LLM completions for a given task are used to learn a task-specific, context-free surrogate model, which is then used to guide program synthesis.

497, TITLE: Planning Robot Placement for Object Grasping
AUTHORS: Manish Saini ; Melvin Paul Jacob ; Minh Nguyen ; Nico Hochgeschwender

In this paper, we propose instead to first find robot placements that would not result in collision with the environment and from where picking up the object is feasible, then evaluate them to find the best placement candidate.

AUTHORS: Rony Abecidan ; Vincent Itier ; J�r�mie Boulanger ; Patrick Bas ; Tom�? Pevn�
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CR, cs.MM]

In this paper, we address this issue focusing on a realistic scenario where practitioners lack crucial information about the limited target set of images under analysis, including details about their development process and even whereas it contains manipulated images or not.
