AUTHORS: Dmitry Shribak ; Chen-Xiao Gao ; Yitong Li ; Chenjun Xiao ; Bo Dai
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite existing methods being promising, the key challenge of extending existing methods for broader real-world applications lies in the computational cost at inference time, i.e., sampling from a diffusion model is considerably slow as it often requires tens to hundreds of iterations to generate even one sample. To circumvent this issue, we propose to leverage the flexibility of diffusion models for RL from a representation learning perspective.

To bridge this gap, we propose Rule-based Data Recycling (RuleR), a data augmentation method incorporating multiple constraints into the original data samples according to predefined rules, which creates new training tasks to consolidate the controllability of LLMs.

CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we take the first step to address the above challenges with our model CAVE (Controllable Authorship Verification Explanations): CAVE generates free-text AV explanations that are controlled to be 1) structured (can be decomposed into sub-explanations with respect to relevant linguistic features), and 2) easily verified for explanation-label consistency (via intermediate labels in sub-explanations). In this work, we train a Llama-3-8B as CAVE; since there are no human-written corpora for AV explanations, we sample silver-standard explanations from GPT-4-TURBO and distill them into a pretrained Llama-3-8B.

AUTHORS: SHILEI CAO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite recent advancements in addressing CTTA, two critical issues remain: 1) The use of a fixed threshold for pseudo-labeling in existing methodologies leads to the generation of low-quality pseudo-labels, as model confidence varies across categories and domains; 2) While current solutions utilize stochastic parameter restoration to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, their capacity to preserve critical information is undermined by its intrinsic randomness. To tackle these challenges, we present CTAOD, aiming to enhance the performance of detection models in CTTA scenarios.

163, TITLE: CBPF: Filtering Poisoned Data Based on Composite Backdoor Attack
AUTHORS: Hanfeng Xia ; Haibo Hong ; Ruili Wang
CATEGORY: cs.CR [cs.CR, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: During the inference stage, backdoor attacks can uphold a high level of accuracy for normal examples, yet when presented with trigger-containing instances, the model may erroneously predict them as the targeted class designated by the attacker. This paper explores strategies for mitigating the risks associated with backdoor attacks by examining the filtration of poisoned samples.We primarily leverage two key characteristics of backdoor attacks: the ability for multiple backdoors to exist simultaneously within a single model, and the discovery through Composite Backdoor Attack (CBA) that altering two triggers in a sample to new target labels does not compromise the original functionality of the triggers, yet enables the prediction of the data as a new target class when both triggers are present simultaneously.Therefore, a novel three-stage poisoning data filtering approach, known as Composite Backdoor Poison Filtering (CBPF), is proposed as an effective solution.
