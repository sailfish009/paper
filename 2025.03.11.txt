In this paper, we propose to establish a direct relation between density and scale through the reparameterization of the scaling parameters and ensure the consistency between them via explicit constraints (i.e., density responds well to changes in frequency).

604, TITLE: Attention on The Wires (AttWire): A Foundation Model for Detecting Devices and Catheters in X-ray Fluoroscopic Images
AUTHORS: YingLiang Ma ; Sandra Howell ; Aldo Rinaldi ; Tarv Dhanjal ; Kawal S. Rhode
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, 68T45 Machine vision and scene understanding, I.2]
HIGHLIGHT: Method: In this paper, a novel attention mechanism was designed to guide a convolution neural network (CNN) model to the areas of wires in X-ray images, as nearly all interventional devices and catheters used in cardiovascular procedures contain wires.

605, TITLE: Towards A Multimodal MRI-Based Foundation Model for Multi-Level Feature Exploration in Segmentation, Molecular Subtyping, and Grading of Glioma
AUTHORS: Somayeh Farahani ; Marjaneh Hejazi ; Antonio Di Ieva ; Emad Fatemizadeh ; Sidong Liu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose the Multi-Task SWIN-UNETR (MTS-UNET) model, a novel foundation-based framework built on the BrainSegFounder model, pretrained on large-scale neuroimaging data.

606, TITLE: Two-stage Deep Denoising with Self-guided Noise Attention for Multimodal Medical Images
AUTHORS: S M A Sharif ; Rizwan Ali Naqvi ; Woong-Kee Loh
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This study addresses the limitation of the contemporary denoising methods with an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven two-stage learning strategy.

607, TITLE: LapLoss: Laplacian Pyramid-based Multiscale Loss for Image Translation
AUTHORS: Krish Didwania ; Ishaan Gakhar ; Prakhar Arya ; Sanskriti Labroo
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces LapLoss, a novel approach designed for I2IT contrast enhancement, based on the Laplacian pyramid-centric networks, forming the core of our proposed methodology.

608, TITLE: SAS: Segment Anything Small for Ultrasound -- A Non-Generative Data Augmentation Technique for Robust Deep Learning in Ultrasound Imaging
AUTHORS: Danielle L. Ferreira ; Ahana Gangopadhyay ; Hsi-Ming Chang ; Ravi Soni ; Gopal Avinash
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in ultrasound (US) images, particularly small ones, is challenging due to noise and variability in imaging conditions (e.g., probe position, patient anatomy, tissue characteristics and pathology). To address this, we introduce Segment Anything Small (SAS), a simple yet effective scale- and texture-aware data augmentation technique designed to enhance the performance of deep learning models for segmenting small anatomical structures in ultrasound images.

609, TITLE: Global Context Is All You Need for Parallel Efficient Tractography Parcellation
AUTHORS: VALENTIN VON BORNHAUPT et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, q-bio.QM, 68T10, 92C55, 65Y05, 68U10, I.4.8; I.5.4; J.3; C.1.4; I.2.6]
HIGHLIGHT: We demonstrate that the local context does not contribute to the accuracy of that approach, and is even detrimental when dealing with pathological cases. Based on this observation, we propose PETParc, a new method for Parallel Efficient Tractography Parcellation.

610, TITLE: Enhanced Pediatric Dental Segmentation Using A Custom SegUNet with VGG19 Backbone on Panoramic Radiographs
AUTHORS: MD OHIDUZZAMAN OVI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This study proposes a custom SegUNet model with a VGG19 backbone, designed explicitly for pediatric dental segmentation and applied to the Children's Dental Panoramic Radiographs dataset.

611, TITLE: Exploring The Usage of Probabilistic Neural Networks for Ionospheric Electron Density Estimation
AUTHORS: Miquel Garcia-Fernandez
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI, 86A10, 62M45,, I.2.6; G.3; J.2]
HIGHLIGHT: In addition, these uncertainty estimates are needed to establish robust protection levels in safety critical applications. To address this challenge, the main objectives of this paper aims at exploring a potential framework capable of providing both point estimates and associated uncertainty measures of ionospheric Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC).
