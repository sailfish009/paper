AUTHORS: Jingyu Liu ; Ce Zhang
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: This can be sub-optimal because we found that LLMs are extremely capable of self-identifying the exact dose of information that a single KV cache can store, and many tokens can be generated confidently without global context. Based on this insight, we introduce HAMburger, a Hierarchically Auto-regressive Model that redefines resource allocation in LLMs by moving beyond uniform computation and storage per token during inference.

To systematically evaluate this under-explored capability, we introduce RelationalFactQA, a new benchmark featuring diverse natural language questions (paired with SQL) and gold-standard tabular answers, specifically designed to assess knowledge retrieval in a structured format.

AUTHORS: XIANGXIN ZHOU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Current practical workarounds use an additional LLM as a model-based verifier; however, this introduces issues such as reliance on a strong verifier LLM, susceptibility to reward hacking, and the practical burden of maintaining the verifier model in memory during training. To address this and extend DeepSeek-R1-Zero-style training to general reasoning domains, we propose a verifier-free method (VeriFree) that bypasses answer verification and instead uses RL to directly maximize the probability of generating the reference answer.

Inspired by the Dual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA task that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within a strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial response; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more deliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the previous stage into precise steps.

To address these challenges, we proposed a patch-level data summarization and augmentation approach, vividly named Scan-and-Print.

174, TITLE: Vision Transformers with Self-Distilled Registers
AUTHORS: Yinjie Chen ; Zipeng Yan ; Chong Zhou ; Bo Dai ; Andrew F. Luo
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: An effective mitigation of this issue is to the addition of register tokens to ViTs, which implicitly "absorb" the artifact term during training. Given the availability of various large-scale pre-trained ViTs, in this paper we aim at equipping them with such register tokens without the need of re-training them from scratch, which is infeasible considering their size.

HIGHLIGHT: Second, a generalized plug-in approach as a SFBR (Semantic Filter Based on Relations) disrupts this consistency through excessive concentration of entity embeddings under entity-based regularization, generating indistinguishable score distributions among relations. In this paper, we introduce a plug-in KGE method, Relation-Semantics Consistent Filter (RSCF), containing more consistent entity-transformation characterized by three features: 1) shared affine transformation of relation embeddings across all relations, 2) rooted entity-transformation that adds an entity embedding to its change represented by the transformed vector, and 3) normalization of the change to prevent scale reduction.

336, TITLE: A False Discovery Rate Control Method Using A Fully Connected Hidden Markov Random Field for Neuroimaging Data
AUTHORS: Taehyo Kim ; Qiran Jia ; Mony J. de Leon ; Hai Shu
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.CV, cs.LG, stat.ME]

To address these challenges, we propose fcHMRF-LIS, a powerful, stable, and scalable spatial FDR control method for voxel-wise multiple testing.
