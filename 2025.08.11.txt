HIGHLIGHT: To tackle thesedifficulties, we propose OM2P (Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy), a noveloffline MARL algorithm to achieve efficient one-step action sampling.

226, TITLE: ViPro-2: Unsupervised State Estimation Via Integrated Dynamics for Guiding Video Prediction
AUTHORS: Patrick Takenaka ; Johannes Maucher ; Marco F. Huber
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In thiswork, we add several improvements to ViPro that enables the model to correctlyinfer states from observations without providing a full ground truth state inthe beginning.

227, TITLE: Unsupervised Partner Design Enables Robust Ad-hoc Teamwork
AUTHORS: Constantin Ruhdorfer ; Matteo Bortoletto ; Victor Oei ; Anna Penzkofer ; Andreas Bulling
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.HC, cs.MA]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce Unsupervised Partner Design (UPD) - a population-free,multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for robust ad-hoc teamwork thatadaptively generates training partners without requiring pretrained partners ormanual parameter tuning.

228, TITLE: An Implemention of Two-Phase Image Segmentation Using The Split Bregman Method
AUTHORS: Olakunle S. Abawonse ; Gï¿½nay Do?an
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, math.OC]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we describe an implementation of the two-phase imagesegmentation algorithm proposed by Goldstein, Bresson, Osher in\cite{gold:bre}.

229, TITLE: Aligning Effective Tokens with Video Anomaly in Large Language Models
AUTHORS: YINGXIAN CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To address thesechallenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities ofVison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we proposeVA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events invarious videos.

230, TITLE: GCHR : Goal-Conditioned Hindsight Regularization for Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: XING LEI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose Hindsight Goal-conditionedRegularization (HGR), a technique that generates action regularization priorsbased on hindsight goals.

231, TITLE: Mask & Match: Learning to Recognize Handwritten Math with Self-Supervised Attention
AUTHORS: Shree Mitra ; Ritabrata Chakraborty ; Nilkanta Sahu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present aself-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need forexpensive labeled data.
