AUTHORS: Zhenya Yang; Zhe Liu; Yuxiang Lu; Liping Hou; Chenxuan Miao; Siyi Peng; Bailan Feng; Xiang Bai; Hengshuang Zhao
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing methods often rely on a single diffusion model to directly map driving actions to videos, which makes learning difficult and leads to physically inconsistent outputs. To overcome these challenges, we propose GenieDrive, a novel framework designed for physics-aware driving video generation.

7, TITLE: DrivePI: Spatial-aware 4D MLLM for Unified Autonomous Driving Understanding, Perception, Prediction and Planning

AUTHORS: Qixin Xu; Haozhe Wang; Che Liu; Fangzhen Lin; Wenhu Chen
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]

To bridge this gap, we propose CogDoc, a unified coarse-to-fine thinking framework that mimics human cognitive processes: a low-resolution "Fast Reading" phase for scalable information localization,followed by a high-resolution "Focused Thinking" phase for deep reasoning.

10, TITLE: LitePT: Lighter Yet Stronger Point Transformer
AUTHORS: Yuanwen Yue; Damien Robert; Jianyuan Wang; Sunghwan Hong; Jan Dirk Wegner; Christian Rupprecht; Konrad Schindler
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We analyse the role of different computational blocks in 3D point cloud networks and find an intuitive behaviour: convolution is adequate to extract low-level geometry at high-resolution in early layers, where attention is expensive without bringing any benefits; attention captures high-level semantics and context in low-resolution, deep layers more efficiently. Guided by this design principle, we propose a new, improved 3D point cloud backbone that employs convolutions in early stages and switches to attention for deeper layers.

AUTHORS: Jia-Nan Li; Jian Guan; Wei Wu; Chongxuan Li
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence.

14, TITLE: AgentSHAP: Interpreting LLM Agent Tool Importance with Monte Carlo Shapley Value Estimation

AUTHORS: Ryan Po; Eric Ryan Chan; Changan Chen; Gordon Wetzstein
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Autoregressive video models are promising for world modeling via next-frame prediction, but they suffer from exposure bias: a mismatch between training on clean contexts and inference on self-generated frames, causing errors to compound and quality to drift over time. We introduce Backwards Aggregation (BAgger), a self-supervised scheme that constructs corrective trajectories from the model's own rollouts, teaching it to recover from its mistakes.

17, TITLE: Training Versatile Coding Agents in Synthetic Environments

31, TITLE: Low-Rank Compression of Language Models Via Differentiable Rank Selection
AUTHORS: Sidhant Sundrani; Francesco Tudisco; Pasquale Minervini
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Yet current approaches are often computationally expensive, data-intensive, susceptible to catastrophic forgetting, and prone to performance degradation in multi-turn interactions or when handling implicit queries.

86, TITLE: CODE ACROSTIC: Robust Watermarking for Code Generation
AUTHORS: Li Lin; Siyuan Xin; Yang Cao; Xiaochun Cao
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CR [CR]
HIGHLIGHT: Watermarking large language models (LLMs) is vital for preventing their misuse, including the fabrication of fake news, plagiarism, and spam. It is especially important to watermark LLM-generated code, as it often contains intellectual property.However, we found that existing methods for watermarking LLM-generated code fail to address comment removal attack.In such cases, an attacker can simply remove the comments from the generated code without affecting its functionality, significantly reducing the effectiveness of current code-watermarking techniques.On the other hand, injecting a watermark into code is challenging because, as previous works have noted, most code represents a low-entropy scenario compared to natural language.

AUTHORS: Zhimao Peng; Enguang Wang; Xialei Liu; Ming-Ming Cheng
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Current SCOOD methods mainly adopt various clustering-based in-distribution sample filtering (IDF) strategies to select clean ID samples from unlabeled data, and take the remaining samples as auxiliary OOD data, which inevitably introduces a large number of noisy samples in training. To address the above issue, we propose a concise SCOOD framework based on predictive sample assignment (PSA).

AUTHORS: Zhimao Peng; Enguang Wang; Fei Yang; Xialei Liu; Ming-Ming Cheng
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, large pre-trained models have a preference for some specific visual patterns, resulting in encoding spurious correlation for unlabeled data and generating noisy pseudo-labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, which contains two modules: Loss Sharpness Penalty (LSP) and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS).

101, TITLE: Measuring What Matters: Scenario-Driven Evaluation for Trajectory Predictors in Autonomous Driving
AUTHORS: Longchao Da; David Isele; Hua Wei; Manish Saroya
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.RO [RO]
HIGHLIGHT: While various methods have been proposed for trajectory prediction, the current evaluation practices still rely on error-based metrics (e.g., ADE, FDE), which reveal the accuracy from a post-hoc view but ignore the actual effect the predictor brings to the self-driving vehicles (SDVs), especially in complex interactive scenarios: a high-quality predictor not only chases accuracy, but should also captures all possible directions a neighbor agent might move, to support the SDVs' cautious decision-making. Given that the existing metrics hardly account for this standard, in our work, we propose a comprehensive pipeline that adaptively evaluates the predictor's performance by two dimensions: accuracy and diversity.

102, TITLE: D3D-VLP: Dynamic 3D Vision-Language-Planning Model for Embodied Grounding and Navigation

178, TITLE: Bi-Erasing: A Bidirectional Framework for Concept Removal in Diffusion Models
AUTHORS: Hao Chen; Yiwei Wang; Songze Li
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Concept erasure, which fine-tunes diffusion models to remove undesired or harmful visual concepts, has become a mainstream approach to mitigating unsafe or illegal image generation in text-to-image models.However, existing removal methods typically adopt a unidirectional erasure strategy by either suppressing the target concept or reinforcing safe alternatives, making it difficult to achieve a balanced trade-off between concept removal and generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Bidirectional Image-Guided Concept Erasure (Bi-Erasing) framework that performs concept suppression and safety enhancement simultaneously.

AUTHORS: Xiang Li; Gang Liu; Weitao Zhou; Hongyi Zhu; Zhong Cao

Our experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks nuPlan demonstrate that SoE method consistently and significantly improves the performance of all the evaluated models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.This module may provide a key and widely applicable support for improving the training efficiency of autonomous driving models.

AUTHORS: Peichun Hua; Hao Li; Shanghao Shi; Zhiyuan Yu; Ning Zhang

AUTHORS: Bo Liu; Qiao Qin; Qinghui He
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing methods, including those leveraging pre-trained vision-language models, often produce highly entangled representations, mixing task-relevant forensic cues (causal features) with spurious or irrelevant patterns (non-causal features), thus limiting generalization. To address this issue, we propose CausalCLIP, a framework that explicitly disentangles causal from non-causal features and employs targeted filtering guided by causal inference principles to retain only the most transferable and discriminative forensic cues.

AUTHORS: Erik Hoel
CATEGORY: arxiv-q-bio.NC [NC]
HIGHLIGHT: Specifically, recent research on the Unfolding Argument and the Substitution Argument has given us formal tools to analyze requirements for a theory of consciousness. I show via a new Proximity Argument that these requirements especially constrain the potential consciousness of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) because of their proximity to systems that are equivalent to LLMs in terms of input/output function; yet, for these functionally equivalent systems, there cannot be any non-trivial theory of consciousness that judges them conscious.
