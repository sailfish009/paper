HIGHLIGHT: Mitigating suchvulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that thelarge-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override theharmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed withoutcompromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we addressthis question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks.

178, TITLE: Provable Unlearning with Gradient Ascent on Two-Layer ReLU Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Odelia Melamed; Gilad Yehudai; Gal Vardi
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We provide a theoreticalanalysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reversethe influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch.Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfythe Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, wequantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfiesthese conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose anew success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful}unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networkswith high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfiesthis criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrainedsolution on the retained data.
