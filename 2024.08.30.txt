In this paper, we present Data Formulator 2, an LLM-powered visualization system to address these challenges.

AUTHORS: Yi-Lin Tuan ; William Yang Wang
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.LG, stat.ML]

To systematically compare these methods and further provide a unified recipe for LM optimization, in this paper, we present a unique angle of gradient analysis of loss functions that simultaneously reward good examples and penalize bad ones in LMs.

HIGHLIGHT: However, two key questions are: (1) are LLM's generated networks realistic, and (2) what are risks of bias, given the importance of demographics in forming social ties? To answer these questions, we develop three prompting methods for network generation and compare the generated networks to real social networks.

162, TITLE: Real-Time Energy Pricing in New Zealand: An Evolving Stream Analysis
AUTHORS: Yibin Sun ; Heitor Murilo Gomes ; Bernhard Pfahringer ; Albert Bifet
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces a group of novel datasets representing real-time time-series and streaming data of energy prices in New Zealand, sourced from the Electricity Market Information (EMI) website maintained by the New Zealand government.

163, TITLE: A GREAT Architecture for Edge-Based Graph Problems Like TSP
AUTHORS: Attila Lischka ; Jiaming Wu ; Morteza Haghir Chehreghani ; Bal�zs Kulcs�r
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Furthermore, models operating on Euclidean coordinates cannot be applied to non-Euclidean versions of routing problems that are often found in real-world settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel GNN-related edge-based neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT).

164, TITLE: SFR-GNN: Simple and Fast Robust GNNs Against Structural Attacks
AUTHORS: XING AI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: To this end, we propose an efficient defense method, called Simple and Fast Robust Graph Neural Network (SFR-GNN), supported by mutual information theory.

165, TITLE: ART: Actually Robust Training
AUTHORS: Sebastian Chwilczy?ski ; Kacper Tr?bacz ; Karol Cyganik ; Mateusz Ma?ecki ; Dariusz Brzezinski
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Furthermore, neural network training often takes on the form of trial and error, lacking a structured and thoughtful process. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, we introduce Art, a Python library designed to help automatically impose rules and standards while developing deep learning pipelines.

166, TITLE: Hyperdimensional Vector Tsetlin Machines with Applications to Sequence Learning and Generation
AUTHORS: Christian D. Blakely
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We construct a two-layered model for learning and generating sequential data that is both computationally fast and competitive with vanilla Tsetlin machines, adding numerous advantages.

167, TITLE: Addressing Common Misinterpretations of KART and UAT in Neural Network Literature
AUTHORS: Vugar Ismailov
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.NE, 26B40, 41A30, 41A63, 68T05]
HIGHLIGHT: This note addresses the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem (KART) and the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT), focusing on their common misinterpretations in some papers related to neural network approximation.

168, TITLE: Maelstrom Networks
AUTHORS: Matthew Evanusa ; Cornelia Ferm�ller ; Yiannis Aloimonos
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, inspired by a combination of controls, reservoir computing, deep learning, and recurrent neural networks, we offer an alternative paradigm that combines the strength of recurrent networks, with the pattern matching capability of feed-forward neural networks, which we call the \textit{Maelstrom Networks} paradigm.

169, TITLE: Six Ways to Implement Divisibility By Three in MiniKanren
AUTHORS: Brett Schreiber ; Brysen Pfingsten ; Jason Hemann
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: Our contributions include an in-depth look at the process of implementing a miniKanren relation and observations on benchmarking \texttt{defrel}s.

170, TITLE: Safe Bayesian Optimization for High-Dimensional Control Systems Via Additive Gaussian Processes
AUTHORS: Hongxuan Wang ; Xiaocong Li ; Adrish Bhaumik ; Prahlad Vadakkepat
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a high-dimensional safe Bayesian optimization method based on additive Gaussian processes to optimize multiple controllers simultaneously and safely.

171, TITLE: Examination of Code Generated By Large Language Models
AUTHORS: ROBIN BEER et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, I.2.2]
HIGHLIGHT: We observed significant differences between the LLMs, between the languages, between algorithm and test codes, and over time.

172, TITLE: NeRF-CA: Dynamic Reconstruction of X-ray Coronary Angiography with Extremely Sparse-views
AUTHORS: Kirsten W. H. Maas ; Danny Ruijters ; Anna Vilanova ; Nicola Pezzotti
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces NeRF-CA, the first step toward a 4D CA reconstruction method that achieves reconstructions from sparse coronary angiograms with cardiac motion.

173, TITLE: A Deep-Learning-Based Lable-free No-Reference Image Quality Assessment Metric: Application in Sodium MRI Denoising
AUTHORS: SHUAIYU YUAN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We note that deep learning (DL) models have a unique characteristic in that they are specialized to a characteristic training set, meaning that deviations between the input testing data from the training data will reduce prediction accuracy. Therefore, we propose a novel DL-based NR-IQA metric, the Model Specialization Metric (MSM), which does not depend on ground-truth images or labels.

174, TITLE: Single-Photon 3D Imaging with Equi-Depth Photon Histograms
AUTHORS: Kaustubh Sadekar ; David Maier ; Atul Ingle
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work we propose a 3D sensing technique based on equi-depth (ED) histograms.
