161, TITLE: Rethinking Out-of-Distribution Detection for Reinforcement Learning: Advancing Methods for Evaluation and Detection
AUTHORS: Linas Nasvytis ; Kai Sandbrink ; Jakob Foerster ; Tim Franzmeyer ; Christian Schroeder de Witt
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Confirming our theoretical predictions, our experimental results suggest that state-of-the-art OOD detectors are not able to identify such anomalies. To address this problem, we propose a novel method for OOD detection, which we call DEXTER (Detection via Extraction of Time Series Representations).

162, TITLE: SleepPPG-Net2: Deep Learning Generalization for Sleep Staging from Photoplethysmography
AUTHORS: SHIREL ATTIA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: Methods: This study aimed to develop a generalizable deep learning model for the task of four class (wake, light, deep, and rapid eye movement (REM)) sleep staging from raw PPG physiological time-series.

163, TITLE: Proposed Modified Computational Model for The Amoeba-inspired Combinatorial Optimization Machine
AUTHORS: Yusuke Miyajima ; Masahito Mochizuki
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cond-mat.dis-nn, cs.AI, nlin.CD, stat.CO]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we examine roles of several elements in a previously proposed computational model of the solution-search process of amoeba and three modifications towards enhancing the solution-search preformance.

164, TITLE: Temporal True and Surrogate Fitness Landscape Analysis for Expensive Bi-Objective Optimisation
AUTHORS: C. J. Rodriguez ; S. L. Thomson ; T. Alderliesten ; P. A. N. Bosman
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Many real-world problems have expensive-to-compute fitness functions and are multi-objective in nature. Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms are often used to tackle such problems.

165, TITLE: Phylogeny-Informed Interaction Estimation Accelerates Co-Evolutionary Learning
AUTHORS: Jack Garbus ; Thomas Willkens ; Alexander Lalejini ; Jordan Pollack
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: To accelerate co-evolutionary systems, we introduce phylogeny-informed interaction estimation, which uses runtime phylogenetic analysis to estimate interaction outcomes between individuals based on how their relatives performed against each other.

166, TITLE: Game Semantics for Higher-Order Unitary Quantum Computation
AUTHORS: Samson Abramsky ; Radha Jagadeesan
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, quant-ph, D.3.3; F.3.2]
HIGHLIGHT: We develop a symmetric monoidal closed category of games, incorporating sums and products, to model quantum computation at higher types.

167, TITLE: Wild Visual Navigation: Fast Traversability Learning Via Pre-Trained Models and Online Self-Supervision
AUTHORS: MAT�AS MATTAMALA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we present Wild Visual Navigation (WVN), an online self-supervised learning system for visual traversability estimation.

168, TITLE: LaPlaSS: Latent Space Planning for Stochastic Systems
AUTHORS: Marlyse Reeves ; Brian C. Williams
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a "generate-and-test" approach to risk-bounded planning in which a planner generates a candidate trajectory using an approximate linear dynamics model and a validator assesses the risk of the trajectory, computing additional safety constraints for the planner if the candidate does not satisfy the desired risk bound.

169, TITLE: Learning Strategies For Successful Crowd Navigation
AUTHORS: Rajshree Daulatabad ; Serena Nath
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.SY, eess.SY]
HIGHLIGHT: Here we present the method, experimental results, and quantitatively evaluate our approach.

170, TITLE: Worst-Case Convergence Time of ML Algorithms Via Extreme Value Theory
AUTHORS: Saeid Tizpaz-Niari ; Sriram Sankaranarayanan
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.PF, cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: Building upon the mathematical tools from EVT, we propose a practical framework to predict the worst-case timing properties of ML.

171, TITLE: VoiceShop: A Unified Speech-to-Speech Framework for Identity-Preserving Zero-Shot Voice Editing
AUTHORS: PHILIP ANASTASSIOU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: We present VoiceShop, a novel speech-to-speech framework that can modify multiple attributes of speech, such as age, gender, accent, and speech style, in a single forward pass while preserving the input speaker's timbre.

172, TITLE: Latent Chemical Space Searching for Plug-in Multi-objective Molecule Generation
AUTHORS: NINGFENG LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: q-bio.BM [q-bio.BM, cs.LG, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: However, challenges remain in multi-objective generation, model adaptability, and practical application in drug discovery. In this study, we developed a versatile 'plug-in' molecular generation model that incorporates multiple objectives related to target affinity, drug-likeness, and synthesizability, facilitating its application in various drug development contexts.

173, TITLE: Res-U2Net: Untrained Deep Learning for Phase Retrieval and Image Reconstruction
AUTHORS: Carlos Osorio Quero ; Daniel Leykam ; Irving Rondon Ojeda
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.optics]
HIGHLIGHT: Here we present a novel untrained Res-U2Net model for phase retrieval.
