242, TITLE: A Pre-Trained Graph-Based Model for Adaptive Sequencing of Educational Documents
AUTHORS: JEAN VASSOYAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.CY, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have greatly contributed to making education more accessible.However, many MOOCs maintain a rigid, one-size-fits-all structure that fails to address the diverse needs and backgrounds of individual learners.Learning path personalization aims to address this limitation, by tailoring sequences of educational content to optimize individual student learning outcomes.Existing approaches, however, often require either massive student interaction data or extensive expert annotation, limiting their broad application.In this study, we introduce a novel data-efficient framework for learning path personalization that operates without expert annotation.Our method employs a flexible recommender system pre-trained with reinforcement learning on a dataset of raw course materials.Through experiments on semi-synthetic data, we show that this pre-training stage substantially improves data-efficiency in a range of adaptive learning scenarios featuring new educational materials.This opens up new perspectives for the design of foundation models for adaptive learning.

303, TITLE: Temporal and Spatial Reservoir Ensembling Techniques for Liquid State Machines
AUTHORS: Anmol Biswas ; Sharvari Ashok Medhe ; Raghav Singhal ; Udayan Ganguly
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: LSMs have been successfully used to showcase decent performance on some neuromorphic vision and speech datasets but a common problem associated with LSMs is that since the model is more-or-less fixed, the main way to improve the performance is by scaling up the Reservoir size, but that only gives diminishing rewards despite a tremendous increase in model size and computation. In this paper, we propose two approaches for effectively ensembling LSM models - Multi-Length Scale Reservoir Ensemble (MuLRE) and Temporal Excitation Partitioned Reservoir Ensemble (TEPRE) and benchmark them on Neuromorphic-MNIST (N-MNIST), Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), and DVSGesture datasets, which are standard neuromorphic benchmarks.

334, TITLE: Hybrid Data-Driven SSM for Interpretable and Label-Free MmWave Channel Prediction
AUTHORS: YIYONG SUN et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: Existing channel prediction methods have limitations: classical model-based methods often struggle to track highly nonlinear channel dynamics due to limited expert knowledge, while emerging data-driven methods typically require substantial labeled data for effective training and often lack interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel hybrid method that integrates a data-driven neural network into a conventional model-based workflow based on a state-space model (SSM), implicitly tracking complex channel dynamics from data without requiring precise expert knowledge.
