AUTHORS: YAN ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]

7, TITLE: Learning Multi-Level Features with Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders
AUTHORS: Bart Bussmann ; Noa Nabeshima ; Adam Karvonen ; Neel Nanda
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, choosing the size of the SAE dictionary (i.e. number of learned concepts) creates a tension: as dictionary size increases to capture more relevant concepts, sparsity incentivizes features to be split or absorbed into more specific features, leaving high-level features missing or warped. We introduce Matryoshka SAEs, a novel variant that addresses these issues by simultaneously training multiple nested dictionaries of increasing size, forcing the smaller dictionaries to independently reconstruct the inputs without using the larger dictionaries.

CATEGORY: cs.CR [cs.CR, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: The analysis tends to focus upon IP addresses, which are not synonymous with user identities, a point of significant interest to investigators. This paper presents several experiments designed to create a novel NFAT approach that can identify users and understand how they are using network based applications whilst the traffic remains encrypted.

456, TITLE: The Human-Machine Identity Blur: A Unified Framework for Cybersecurity Risk Management in 2025
AUTHORS: Kush Janani
CATEGORY: cs.CR [cs.CR, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Drawing from industry data, expert insights, and real-world incident analysis, we identify key governance gaps in current identity management models that treat human and machine entities as separate domains. To address these challenges, we propose a Unified Identity Governance Framework based on four core principles: treating identity as a continuum rather than a binary distinction, applying consistent risk evaluation across all identity types, implementing continuous verification guided by zero trust principles, and maintaining governance throughout the entire identity lifecycle.

AUTHORS: Stefan Rass ; Martin Dallinger
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, 68T10 (Primary), 68M25, 62J86 (Secondary)]
HIGHLIGHT: In cases where the data is already available, how do we find out if the data was already manipulated, i.e., ``poisoned'', so that an undesired behavior would be trained into a machine learning model? This is a challenge fundamentally different to (just) improving approximation accuracy or efficiency, and we provide a method to test training data for flaws, to establish a trustworthy ground-truth for a subsequent training of machine learning models (of any kind).

CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CV, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing methods for detecting speech deepfakes primarily rely on supervised learning, which suffers from two critical limitations: limited generalization to unseen synthesis techniques and a lack of explainability. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing a novel interpretable one-class detection framework, which reframes speech deepfake detection as an anomaly detection task.

480, TITLE: Informer in Algorithmic Investment Strategies on High Frequency Bitcoin Data
AUTHORS: Filip Stefaniuk ; Robert ?lepaczuk
CATEGORY: q-fin.TR [q-fin.TR, cs.LG, cs.NE, q-fin.PM]

The primary contribution of this study is the application and assessment of the RMSE, GMADL, and Quantile loss functions with the Informer model to forecast future returns, subsequently using these forecasts to develop automated trading strategies.
