229, TITLE: Efficient and Robust Knowledge Distillation from A Stronger Teacher Based on Correlation Matching
AUTHORS: Wenqi Niu ; Yingchao Wang ; Guohui Cai ; Hanpo Hou

239, TITLE: BEVLoc: Cross-View Localization and Matching Via Birds-Eye-View Synthesis
AUTHORS: Christopher Klammer ; Michael Kaess
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV, I.2.9]
HIGHLIGHT: Taking inspiration from the autonomous driving community, we propose a novel framework for synthesizing a birds-eye-view (BEV) scene representation to match and localize against an aerial map in off-road environments.

240, TITLE: Combining Planning and Diffusion for Mobility with Unknown Dynamics
AUTHORS: Yajvan Ravan ; Zhutian Yang ; Tao Chen ; Tom�s Lozano-P�rez ; Leslie Pack Kaelbling
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a hierarchical algorithm for long-horizon robot manipulation problems in which the dynamics are partially unknown.

241, TITLE: An Approach for Auto Generation of Labeling Functions for Software Engineering Chatbots
AUTHORS: Ebube Alor ; Ahmad Abdellatif ; SayedHassan Khatoonabadi ; Emad Shihab
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, these approaches require human intervention to generate rules, called labeling functions (LFs), that identify and categorize user queries based on specific patterns in the data. To address this issue, we propose an approach to automatically generate LFs by extracting patterns from labeled user queries.
