CATEGORY: cs.IR [cs.IR, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Furthermore, though existing works endow lower weights to irrelevant interactions, they may still dilute the domain information and impede the cross-domain recommendation. To address the above issues, we propose a reinforcement learning-based solution, namely RL-ISN, which consists of a basic cross-domain recommender and a reinforcement learning-based domain filter.

AUTHORS: YUCHENG ZHOU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.IR [cs.IR, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Thereby, we propose multiple retrievers as negative generators improve the ranker's robustness, where i) involving extensive out-of-distribution label noises renders the ranker against each noise distribution, and ii) diverse hard negatives from a joint distribution are relatively close to the ranker's negative distribution, leading to more challenging thus effective training.

AUTHORS: Biraja Ghoshal ; Allan Tucker
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, eess.IV]
HIGHLIGHT: Furthermore, we show that decisions informed by loss-calibrated uncertainty can improve diagnostic performance to a greater extent than straightforward alternatives. We propose Maximum Uncertainty Calibration Error (MUCE) as a metric to measure calibrated confidence, in addition to its prediction especially for high-risk applications, where the goal is to minimise the worst-case deviation between error and estimated uncertainty.

95, TITLE: Catastrophic Overfitting Is A Bug But Also A Feature
AUTHORS: GUILLERMO ORTIZ-JIMÉNEZ et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite clear computational advantages in building robust neural networks, adversarial training (AT) using single-step methods is unstable as it suffers from catastrophic overfitting (CO): Networks gain non-trivial robustness during the first stages of adversarial training, but suddenly reach a breaking point where they quickly lose all robustness in just a few iterations.

CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.NE, q-bio.NC, stat.ML]

To address this challenge, we propose Deep Neural Imputation (DNI), a framework to recover missing values from electrodes by learning from data collected across spatial locations, days, and participants.

99, TITLE: Inherent Inconsistencies of Feature Importance
AUTHORS: Nimrod Harel ; Ran Gilad-Bachrach ; Uri Obolski
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.HC]

AUTHORS: Jonathan Crabbé ; Alicia Curth ; Ioana Bica ; Mihaela van der Schaar
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ME]
HIGHLIGHT: Yet, understanding these models can be crucial -- in a medical context, for example, discovered knowledge on treatment effect heterogeneity could inform treatment prescription in clinical practice. In this work, we therefore use post-hoc feature importance methods to identify features that influence the model's predictions.

101, TITLE: Interaction-Grounded Learning with Action-inclusive Feedback
AUTHORS: TENGYANG XIE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.HC, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: Prior analyzed approaches fail when the feedback vector contains the action, which significantly limits IGL's success in many potential scenarios such as Brain-computer interface (BCI) or Human-computer interface (HCI) applications. We address this by creating an algorithm and analysis which allows IGL to work even when the feedback vector contains the action, encoded in any fashion.

AUTHORS: Sebastian Ament ; Carla Gomes
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.MS, math.OC, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we observe that a wide range of kernels gives rise to structured matrices, enabling an exact $\mathcal{O}(n^2d)$ matrix-vector multiply for gradient observations and $\mathcal{O}(n^2d^2)$ for Hessian observations. Beyond canonical kernel classes, we derive a programmatic approach to leveraging this type of structure for transformations and combinations of the discussed kernel classes, which constitutes a structure-aware automatic differentiation algorithm.

105, TITLE: Improving Diversity with Adversarially Learned Transformations for Domain Generalization
AUTHORS: TEJAS GOKHALE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, na\"ive diversity based augmentations do not work effectively for domain generalization either because they cannot model large domain shift, or because the span of transforms that are pre-specified do not cover the types of shift commonly occurring in domain generalization. To address this issue, we present a novel framework that uses adversarially learned transformations (ALT) using a neural network to model plausible, yet hard image transformations that fool the classifier.

AUTHORS: Tianlong Chen ; Sijia Liu ; Shiyu Chang ; Lisa Amini ; Zhangyang Wang
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]

AUTHORS: Harshavardhan Kamarthi ; Lingkai Kong ; Alexander Rodríguez ; Chao Zhang ; B. Aditya Prakash
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]

We close both these gaps and propose PROFHIT, which is a fully probabilistic hierarchical forecasting model that jointly models forecast distribution of entire hierarchy.
