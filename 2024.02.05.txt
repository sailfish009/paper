1, TITLE: Few-Shot Learning on Graphs: from Meta-learning to Pre-training and Prompting
AUTHORS: XINGTONG YU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.SI]

Within each category, we analyze the relationships among these methods and compare their strengths and limitations.

2, TITLE: Getting The Most Out of Your Tokenizer for Pre-training and Domain Adaptation

AUTHORS: SHIHAN DOU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.CL]

To tackle these challenges, we introduce StepCoder, a novel RL framework for code generation, consisting of two main components: CCCS addresses the exploration challenge by breaking the long sequences code generation task into a Curriculum of Code Completion Subtasks, while FGO only optimizes the model by masking the unexecuted code segments to provide Fine-Grained Optimization.

AUTHORS: Samy Jelassi ; David Brandfonbrener ; Sham M. Kakade ; Eran Malach
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Transformers are the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, but there is growing interest in models that use a fixed-size latent state that does not depend on the sequence length, which we refer to as "generalized state space models" (GSSMs). In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context.

AUTHORS: Jiale Zhao ; Wanru Zhuang ; Jia Song ; Yaqi Li ; Shuqi Lu
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, q-bio.BM]

164, TITLE: Integrating Large Language Models in Causal Discovery: A Statistical Causal Approach
AUTHORS: MASAYUKI TAKAYAMA et. al.

To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel methodology for causal inference, in which SCD methods and knowledge based causal inference (KBCI) with a large language model (LLM) are synthesized through "statistical causal prompting (SCP)" for LLMs and prior knowledge augmentation for SCD.
