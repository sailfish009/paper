HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose VibroTag, a robust and practical vibration based sensing scheme that works with smartphones with different hardware, can extract fine-grained vibration signatures of different surfaces, and is robust to environmental noise and hardware based irregularities. We implemented VibroTag on two different Android phones and evaluated in multiple different environments where we collected data from 4 individuals for 5 to 20 consecutive days.
