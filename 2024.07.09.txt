AUTHORS: Bidur Khanal ; Tianhong Dai ; Binod Bhattarai ; Cristian Linte
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although several methods have been proposed to enhance classification performance in the presence of noisy labels, they face some challenges: 1) a struggle with class-imbalanced datasets, leading to the frequent overlooking of minority classes as noisy samples; 2) a singular focus on maximizing performance using noisy datasets, without incorporating experts-in-the-loop for actively cleaning the noisy labels. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a two-phase approach that combines Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) and active learning.

AUTHORS: Timo Bertram ; Johannes F�rnkranz ; Martin M�ller

In this work, we show how one can solve this problem via a suitable adaptation of the CLIP framework.This adaptation is not entirely straight-forward, because although the InfoNCE loss used by CLIP has achieved great success in computer vision and multi-modal domains, its batch-construction technique requires the ability to compare arbitrary items, and is not well-defined if one item has multiple positive associations in the same batch.

HIGHLIGHT: In general, the activation likelihood could be any non-decreasing function of the discount, whereas, our focus lies on the case when the activation likelihood is an affine function of the discount, potentially varying across different users. As this problem is shown to be NP-hard, we propose and analyze an efficient (1-1/e)-approximation algorithm.

402, TITLE: Object Recognition in Primates: What Can Early Visual Areas Contribute?
AUTHORS: Christian Quaia ; Richard J Krauzlis
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.CV, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Because peripheral recognition is both crucial to enable fine recognition (by bringing an object of interest on the fovea), and probably sufficient to account for a considerable fraction of our daily recognition-guided behavior, we think that the current focus on area IT and foveal processing is too narrow. We propose that rather than a hierarchical system with IT-like properties as its primary aim, object recognition should be seen as a parallel process, with high-accuracy foveal modules operating in parallel with lower-accuracy and faster modules that can operate across the visual field.

403, TITLE: Differentiable Modal Synthesis for Physical Modeling of Planar String Sound and Motion Simulation
AUTHORS: Jin Woo Lee ; Jaehyun Park ; Min Jun Choi ; Kyogu Lee

To address this gap, we introduce a novel model for simulating the spatio-temporal motion of nonlinear strings, integrating modal synthesis and spectral modeling within a neural network framework.
