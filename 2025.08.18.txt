HIGHLIGHT: As the same problem arises in today's language models (LMs), weinvestigate the relationship between LM--brain alignment and two neuralmetrics: (1) the level of brain activation during processing of sentences,targeting linguistic processing, and (2) a novel measure of meaning consistencyacross input modalities, which quantifies how consistently a brain regionresponds to the same concept across paradigms (sentence, word cloud, image)using an fMRI dataset (Pereira et al., 2018). Our experiments show that bothlanguage-only and language-vision models predict the signal better in moremeaning-consistent areas of the brain, even when these areas are not stronglysensitive to language processing, suggesting that LMs might internallyrepresent cross-modal conceptual meaning.

HIGHLIGHT: The majority ofexisting approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers relyon traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning onfinal-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMsunder the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capablecommercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, wepropose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs viaprompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicitedfrom its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) usingprompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtainsufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then appliedto these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner.Experiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strongaccuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework fromboth open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework isdata-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings(i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features.

88, TITLE: HierOctFusion: Multi-scale Octree-based 3D Shape Generation Via Part-Whole-Hierarchy Message Passing
AUTHORS: Xinjie Gao ; Bi'an Du ; Wei Hu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While recent octree-based diffusionmodels offer a promising balance between efficiency and quality throughhierarchical generation, they often overlook two key insights: 1) existingmethods typically model 3D objects as holistic entities, ignoring theirsemantic part hierarchies and limiting generalization; and 2) holistichigh-resolution modeling is computationally expensive, whereas real-worldobjects are inherently sparse and hierarchical, making them well-suited forlayered generation. Motivated by these observations, we propose HierOctFusion,a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model that enhances hierarchicalfeature interaction for generating fine-grained and sparse object structures.Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention conditioning mechanism that injectspart-level information into the generation process, enabling semantic featuresto propagate effectively across hierarchical levels from parts to the whole.Additionally, we construct a 3D dataset with part category annotations using apre-trained segmentation model to facilitate training and evaluation.Experiments demonstrate that HierOctFusion achieves superior shape quality andefficiency compared to prior methods.
