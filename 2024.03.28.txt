HIGHLIGHT: The tool supports practically relevant forms of pointer arithmetic, block operations, address alignment, or memory reinterpretation. We present the overall architecture of the tool, along with selected implementation details of the tool as well as its extension into so-called Predator Hunting Party, which utilises multiple concurrently-running Predator analysers with various restrictions on their behaviour.

238, TITLE: Deep Learning Segmentation and Classification of Red Blood Cells Using A Large Multi-Scanner Dataset
AUTHORS: Mohamed Elmanna ; Ahmed Elsafty ; Yomna Ahmed ; Muhammad Rushdi ; Ahmed Morsy
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we report a new large red blood cell (RBC) image dataset and propose a two-stage deep learning framework for RBC image segmentation and classification.

239, TITLE: Users Prefer Jpegli Over Same-sized Libjpeg-turbo or MozJPEG
AUTHORS: Martin Bruse ; Luca Versari ; Zoltan Szabadka ; Jyrki Alakuijala
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, I.4.2]
HIGHLIGHT: We performed pairwise comparisons by human raters of JPEG images from MozJPEG, libjpeg-turbo and our new Jpegli encoder.

240, TITLE: CT-3DFlow : Leveraging 3D Normalizing Flows for Unsupervised Detection of Pathological Pulmonary CT Scans
AUTHORS: AISSAM DJAHNINE et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Normalizing Flows (NF) have the ability to directly learn the probability distribution of training examples through an invertible architecture. We leverage this property in a novel 3D NF-based model named CT-3DFlow, specifically tailored for patient-level pulmonary pathology detection in chest CT data.

241, TITLE: A Vascular Synthetic Model for Improved Aneurysm Segmentation and Detection Via Deep Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Rafic Nader ; Florent Autrusseau ; Vincent L'Allinec ; Romain Bourcier
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We hereby present a full synthetic model, able to mimic the various constituents of the cerebral vascular tree: the cerebral arteries, the bifurcations and the intracranial aneurysms.

242, TITLE: HEMIT: H&E to Multiplex-immunohistochemistry Image Translation with Dual-Branch Pix2pix Generator
AUTHORS: Chang Bian ; Beth Philips ; Tim Cootes ; Martin Fergie
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This work presents HEMIT, a dataset designed for translating Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) sections to multiplex-immunohistochemistry (mIHC) images, featuring DAPI, CD3, and panCK markers.

243, TITLE: Transformers-based Architectures for Stroke Segmentation: A Review
AUTHORS: Yalda Zafari-Ghadim ; Essam A. Rashed ; Mohamed Mabrok
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Recently, Transformers, initially designed for natural language processing, have exhibited remarkable capabilities in various computer vision applications, including medical image analysis. This comprehensive review aims to provide an in-depth exploration of the cutting-edge Transformer-based architectures applied in the context of stroke segmentation.
