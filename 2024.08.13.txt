110, TITLE: Context-Driven Index Trimming: A Data Quality Perspective to Enhancing Precision of RALMs
AUTHORS: KEXIN MA et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RALMs) have made significant strides in enhancing the accuracy of generated responses.However, existing research often overlooks the data quality issues within retrieval results, often caused by inaccurate existing vector-distance-based retrieval methods.We propose to boost the precision of RALMs' answers from a data quality perspective through the Context-Driven Index Trimming (CDIT) framework, where Context Matching Dependencies (CMDs) are employed as logical data quality rules to capture and regulate the consistency between retrieved contexts.Based on the semantic comprehension capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), CDIT can effectively identify and discard retrieval results that are inconsistent with the query context and further modify indexes in the database, thereby improving answer quality.Experiments demonstrate on challenging question-answering tasks.Also, the flexibility of CDIT is verified through its compatibility with various language models and indexing methods, which offers a promising approach to bolster RALMs' data quality and retrieval precision jointly.

117, TITLE: ClickAttention: Click Region Similarity Guided Interactive Segmentation
AUTHORS: LONG XU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Interactive segmentation algorithms based on click points have garnered significant attention from researchers in recent years.However, existing studies typically use sparse click maps as model inputs to segment specific target objects, which primarily affect local regions and have limited abilities to focus on the whole target object, leading to increased times of clicks.In addition, most existing algorithms can not balance well between high performance and efficiency.To address this issue, we propose a click attention algorithm that expands the influence range of positive clicks based on the similarity between positively-clicked regions and the whole input.We also propose a discriminative affinity loss to reduce the attention coupling between positive and negative click regions to avoid an accuracy decrease caused by mutual interference between positive and negative clicks.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is superior to existing methods and achieves cutting-edge performance in fewer parameters.An interactive demo and all reproducible codes will be released at https://github.com/hahamyt/ClickAttention.
