AUTHORS: YINONG OLIVER WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Conventional fairness metrics, which focus on discrete accuracy-based evaluations (i.e., prediction correctness), fail to capture the implicit impact of model uncertainty (e.g., higher model confidence about one group over another despite similar accuracy). To address this limitation, we propose an uncertainty-aware fairness metric, UCerF, to enable a fine-grained evaluation of model fairness that is more reflective of the internal bias in model decisions compared to conventional fairness measures.

277, TITLE: ScaleLong: A Multi-Timescale Benchmark for Long Video Understanding
AUTHORS: DAVID MA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Although long-video understanding demands that models capture hierarchical temporal information -- from clip (seconds) and shot (tens of seconds) to event (minutes) and story (hours) -- existing benchmarks either neglect this multi-scale design or scatter scale-specific questions across different videos, preventing direct comparison of model performance across timescales on the same content. To address this, we introduce ScaleLong, the first benchmark to disentangle these factors by embedding questions targeting four hierarchical timescales -- clip (seconds), shot (tens of seconds), event (minutes), and story (hours) -- all within the same video content.

HIGHLIGHT: However, to date, these approaches face a performance bottleneck due to two inherent limitations, \textit{e.g.}, the over-coupling problem within MT structure owing to the employment of exponential moving average (EMA) mechanism, as well as the severe cognitive bias between two students of DS structure, both of which potentially lead to reduced efficacy, or even model collapse eventually. To mitigate these issues, a Decoupled Competitive Framework (DCF) is elaborated in this work, which utilizes a straightforward competition mechanism for the update of EMA, effectively decoupling students and teachers in a dynamical manner.
