AUTHORS: Weiheng Zhao; Zilong Huang; Jiashi Feng; Xinggang Wang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This stems from CLIP's training objective, which optimizes only global image-text similarity and overlooks token-level supervision - limiting its ability to achieve fine-grained visual-text alignment.

HIGHLIGHT: Current approaches, such as human calibration or performance-based scoring, fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, i.e. problems currently unsolvable by humans and LLMs, because they are not scalable, time-consuming, and ground truth dependent. Therefore, we propose a new method for estimating problem difficulty, LLM compare, that addresses these limitations.

AUTHORS: Hao Chen; Junyang Chen; Jinshan Pan; Jiangxin Dong
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent diffusion-based one-step methods have shown remarkable progress in the field of image super-resolution, yet they remain constrained by three critical limitations: (1) inferior fidelity performance caused by the information loss from compression encoding of low-quality (LQ) inputs; (2) insufficient region-discriminative activation of generative priors; (3) misalignment between text prompts and their corresponding semantic regions. To address these limitations, we propose CODSR, a controllable one-step diffusion network for image super-resolution.

AUTHORS: Meng Wei; Cheng Zhang; Jianmin Zheng; Hamid Rezatofighi; Jianfei Cai
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Rather than proposing new texture formulations, we take a step back to examine the characteristics of existing textured Gaussian methods and identify two key limitations in common: (1) Textures are typically defined in canonical space, leading to inefficient sampling that wastes textures' capacity on low-contribution regions; and (2) texture parameterization is uniformly assigned across all Gaussians, regardless of their visual complexity, resulting in over-parameterization. In this work, we address these issues through two simple yet effective strategies: adaptive sampling based on the Gaussian density distribution and error-driven anisotropic parameterization that allocates texture resources according to rendering error.

AUTHORS: Qi Chen; Fabio Ramos; Alán Aspuru-Guzik; Florian Shkurti
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Large language models (LLMs) and chemistry foundation models offer rich priors to enhance BO, but high-dimensional features, costly in-context learning, and the computational burden of deep Bayesian surrogates hinder their full utilization. To address these challenges, we propose a likelihood-free BO method that bypasses explicit surrogate modeling and directly leverages priors from general LLMs and chemistry-specific foundation models to inform acquisition functions.

HIGHLIGHT: While deep learning-based detection methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO-Road Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC).

HIGHLIGHT: However, existing approaches face fundamental limitations in modeling the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of traffic dynamics, particularly in simultaneously addressing (1) the decaying significance of temporal dependencies across input sequences and prediction horizons, (2) multi-scale spatial interactions spanning local congestion patterns and global functional correlations, and (3) inter-sample temporal variance in evolving traffic states. To address these limitations, this paper proposes MVA-DCNet (Multi-View Attention Dilated Convolutional Network), a novel deep learning architecture incorporating a multidimensional temporal analysis framework that systematically examines temporal influence mechanisms through three complementary perspectives: inter-sample variance, intra-sequence temporal importance, and output sequence temporal propagation.

HIGHLIGHT: Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property.

148, TITLE: Semantic Mismatch and Perceptual Degradation: A New Perspective on Image Editing Immunity
AUTHORS: Shuai Dong; Jie Zhang; Guoying Zhao; Shiguang Shan; Xilin Chen
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We argue that immunization success should instead be defined by the edited output either semantically mismatching the prompt or suffering substantial perceptual degradations, both of which thwart malicious intent. To operationalize this principle, we propose Synergistic Intermediate Feature Manipulation (SIFM), a method that strategically perturbs intermediate diffusion features through dual synergistic objectives: (1) maximizing feature divergence from the original edit trajectory to disrupt semantic alignment with the expected edit, and (2) minimizing feature norms to induce perceptual degradations.

222, TITLE: OmniDrive-R1: Reinforcement-driven Interleaved Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought for Trustworthy Vision-Language Autonomous Driving
AUTHORS: Zhenguo Zhang; Haohan Zhen; Yishen Wang; Le Xu; Tianchen Deng; Xuefeng Chen; Qu Chen; Bo Zhang; Wuxiong Huang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving (AD) is critically hindered by reliability failures, most notably object hallucination. This failure stems from their reliance on ungrounded, text-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.While existing multi-modal CoT approaches attempt mitigation, they suffer from two fundamental flaws: (1) decoupled perception and reasoning stages that prevent end-to-end joint optimization, and (2) reliance on expensive, dense localization labels.Thus we introduce OmniDrive-R1, an end-to-end VLM framework designed for autonomous driving, which unifies perception and reasoning through an interleaved Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (iMCoT) mechanism.
