This work proposes a Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) methodologyto enhance model interpretability for microscopy image classification.Exploiting benchmark datasets from three different microscopic image domains(plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells), we show how a DRL framework, basedon transferring a representation learnt from synthetic data, can provide a goodtrade-off between accuracy and interpretability in this domain.

HIGHLIGHT: We train a 7B dLLM, \textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing howit differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal theirgeneration should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasingthe sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also theirgeneration order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates andmaintain training efficiency, we propose \textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novelsampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions usedin training.

HIGHLIGHT: Moreover,it is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achievebeyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novelimitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration(ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policyoptimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with highuncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and(2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from thedemonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance.Empirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-artimitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achievesbeyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrationsthan in previous work.

AUTHORS: XUAN DING et. al.

152, TITLE: A Spatio-Temporal Point Process for Fine-Grained Modeling of Reading Behavior
AUTHORS: Francesco Ignazio Re ; Andreas Opedal ; Glib Manaiev ; Mario Giulianelli ; Ryan Cotterell
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL, q-bio.NC]

In this paper, we propose a more general probabilisticmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land inspace and when they take place in time.
