AUTHORS: Haonan Yang; Jianchao Tang; Zhuo Li

HIGHLIGHT: While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation.

AUTHORS: Dengzhao Fang; Jingtong Gao; Yu Li; Xiangyu Zhao; Yi Chang

HIGHLIGHT: Despite its great potential in unifying retrieval and ranking, existing GSR frameworks still face two critical limitations: (1) impure and unstable semantic tokenization, where quantization methods struggle with interaction noise and codebook collapse, resulting in SIDs with ambiguous discrimination; and (2) lossy and weakly structured generation, where reliance solely on coarse-grained discrete tokens inevitably introduces information loss and neglects items' hierarchical logic. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative recommendation framework, PRISM, with Purified Representation and Integrated Semantic Modeling.

AUTHORS: Shuozhe Li; Jincheng Cao; Bodun Hu; Aryan Mokhtari; Leqi Liu; Amy Zhang

HIGHLIGHT: However, we identify a critical trade-off: while unconstrained RFT achieves strong reasoning performance, it severely compromises model trustworthiness by amplifying hallucination and worsening calibration; conversely, RKL-constrained RFT preserves trustworthiness but limits reasoning gains due to its unbounded penalty on exploratory deviations. To resolve this tension, we introduce CARE-RFT (Confidence-Anchored Regularized Reinforcement Finetuning), a novel method that replaces standard reverse KL regularization with a skew reverse KL divergence.

AUTHORS: Lijiale Yang; Bangjie Li; Dongdong Guan; Deliang Xiang
CATEGORY: Remote Sensing [REMOTE SENSING]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing FSOD methods face two critical challenges in remote sensing images (RSIs): (1) features of small targets within remote sensing images are incompletely represented due to extremely small-scale and cluttered backgrounds, which weakens discriminability and leads to significant detection degradation; (2) unified classification boundaries fail to handle the distinct confidence distributions between well-sampled base classes and sparsely sampled novel classes, leading to ineffective knowledge transfer. To address these issues, we propose TS-FSOD, a Transfer-Stable FSOD framework with two key innovations.
