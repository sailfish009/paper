HIGHLIGHT: However, they rely heavily on the Gaussian mechanism, which may overly perturb the gradients and degrade the accuracy, especially in stronger privacy regimes (e.g., the privacy budget $\epsilon < 3$). To address such limitations, we propose a novel Language Model-based Optimal Differential Privacy (LMO-DP) mechanism, which takes the first step to enable the tight composition of accurately fine-tuning (large) language models with a sub-optimal DP mechanism, even in strong privacy regimes (e.g., $0.1\leq \epsilon<3$).

AUTHORS: Manfred Buchacher ; Manuel Kauers
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC]
HIGHLIGHT: For a given ideal I in K[x_1,...,x_n,y_1,...,y_m] in a polynomial ring with n+m variables, we want to find all elements that can be written as f-g for some f in K[x_1,...,x_n] and some g in K[y_1,...,y_m], i.e., all elements of I that contain no term involving at the same time one of the x_1,...,x_n and one of the y_1,...,y_m. For principal ideals and for ideals of dimension zero, we give a algorithms that compute all these polynomials in a finite number of steps.

We train this model on unlabelled ECoG recordings, and subsequently use it to transform ECoG from labeled speech sessions into wav2vec's representation space, before finally training a supervised encoder-decoder to map these representations to text.

To harness the generative power of DMs while avoiding such approximations, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that performs posterior sampling for general inverse problems by reducing it to sampling the posterior of a Gaussian denoising problem.
