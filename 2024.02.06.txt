HIGHLIGHT: We argue that there is a need for more research focusing on the human aspect of these privacy issues: e.g., research on how design paradigms for LLMs affect users' disclosure behaviors, users' mental models and preferences for privacy controls, and the design of tools, systems, and artifacts that empower end-users to reclaim ownership over their personal data. To build usable, efficient, and privacy-friendly systems powered by these models with imperfect privacy properties, our goal is to initiate discussions to outline an agenda for conducting human-centered research on privacy issues in LLM-powered systems.

394, TITLE: Natural Language Guidance of High-fidelity Text-to-speech with Synthetic Annotations
AUTHORS: Dan Lyth ; Simon King
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a scalable method for labeling various aspects of speaker identity, style, and recording conditions.

395, TITLE: ISPA: Inter-Species Phonetic Alphabet for Transcribing Animal Sounds
AUTHORS: Masato Hagiwara ; Marius Miron ; Jen-Yu Liu
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, cs.LG]

396, TITLE: Computing Generic Fibres of Polynomial Ideals with FGLM and Hensel Lifting
AUTHORS: J�r�my Berthomieu ; Rafael Mohr
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC, math.AC]
HIGHLIGHT: We describe a version of the FGLM algorithm that can be used to compute generic fibers of positive-dimensional polynomial ideals.

397, TITLE: Computing Roadmaps in Unbounded Smooth Real Algebraic Sets II: Algorithm and Complexity
AUTHORS: R�mi Pr�bet ; Mohab Safey El Din ; �ric Schost
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC, math.AG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we make effective a connectivity result we previously proved, to design a Monte Carlo algorithm which, on input (i) a finite sequence of polynomials defining $V$ (and satisfying some regularity assumptions) and (ii) an algebraic representation of finitely many query points $\mathcal{P}$ in $V$, computes a roadmap for $(V, \mathcal{P})$.

398, TITLE: One-class Anomaly Detection Through Color-to-thermal AI for Building Envelope Inspection
AUTHORS: Polina Kurtser ; Kailun Feng ; Thomas Olofsson ; Aitor De Andres
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a label-free method for detecting anomalies during thermographic inspection of building envelopes.

399, TITLE: Panoramic Image Inpainting With Gated Convolution And Contextual Reconstruction Loss
AUTHORS: Li Yu ; Yanjun Gao ; Farhad Pakdaman ; Moncef Gabbouj
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT: However, it is challenging for existing methods to distinguish valid pixels from invalid pixels and find suitable references for corrupted areas, thus leading to artifacts in the inpainted results. In response to these challenges, we propose a panoramic image inpainting framework that consists of a Face Generator, a Cube Generator, a side branch, and two discriminators.

400, TITLE: Fully Differentiable Correlation-driven 2D/3D Registration for X-ray to CT Image Fusion
AUTHORS: Minheng Chen ; Zhirun Zhang ; Shuheng Gu ; Zhangyang Ge ; Youyong Kong
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In recent years, some learning-based fully differentiable methods have produced beneficial outcomes while the process of feature extraction and gradient flow transmission still lack controllability and interpretability. To alleviate these problems, in this work, we propose a novel fully differentiable correlation-driven network using a dual-branch CNN-transformer encoder which enables the network to extract and separate low-frequency global features from high-frequency local features.

401, TITLE: Perceptual Learned Image Compression Via End-to-End JND-Based Optimization
AUTHORS: Farhad Pakdaman ; Sanaz Nami ; Moncef Gabbouj
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT: Perceptual optimization of LC to comply with the Human Visual System (HVS) is among such criteria, which has not been fully explored yet. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel framework to integrate Just Noticeable Distortion (JND) principles into LC.
