86, TITLE: How Fly Neural Perception Mechanisms Enhance Visuomotor Control of Micro Robots
AUTHORS: Renyuan Liu ; Haoting Zhou ; Chuankai Fang ; Qinbing Fu
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Anyone who has tried to swat a fly has likely been frustrated by itsremarkable agility.This ability stems from its visual neural perception system,particularly the collision-selective neurons within its small brain.Forautonomous robots operating in complex and unfamiliar environments, achievingsimilar agility is highly desirable but often constrained by the trade-offbetween computational cost and performance.In this context, insect-inspiredintelligence offers a parsimonious route to low-power, computationallyefficient frameworks.In this paper, we propose an attention-driven visuomotorcontrol strategy inspired by a specific class of fly visual projectionneurons-the lobula plate/lobula column type-2 (LPLC2)-and their associatedescape behaviors.To our knowledge, this represents the first embodiment of anLPLC2 neural model in the embedded vision of a physical mobile robot, enablingcollision perception and reactive evasion.The model was simplified andoptimized at 70KB in memory to suit the computational constraints of avision-based micro robot, the Colias, while preserving key neural perceptionmechanisms.We further incorporated multi-attention mechanisms to emulate thedistributed nature of LPLC2 responses, allowing the robot to detect and reactto approaching targets both rapidly and selectively.We systematically evaluatedthe proposed method against a state-of-the-art locust-inspired collisiondetection model.Results showed that the fly-inspired visuomotor model achievedcomparable robustness, at success rate of 96.1% in collision detection whileproducing more adaptive and elegant evasive maneuvers.Beyond demonstrating aneffective collision-avoidance strategy, this work highlights the potential offly-inspired neural models for advancing research into collective behaviors ininsect intelligence.

113, TITLE: Dense-Jump Flow Matching with Non-Uniform Time Scheduling for Robotic Policies: Mitigating Multi-Step Inference Degradation
AUTHORS: ZIDONG CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We further observe thatincreasing the number of Euler integration steps during inferencecounter-intuitively and universally degrades policy performance. We attributethis to (i) additional, uniformly spaced integration steps oversample thelate-time region, thereby constraining actions towards the trainingtrajectories and reducing generalisation; and (ii) the learned velocity fieldbecoming non-Lipschitz as integration time approaches 1, causing instability.To address these issues, we propose a novel policy that utilises non-uniformtime scheduling (e.g., U-shaped) during training, which emphasises both earlyand late temporal stages to regularise policy training, and a dense-jumpintegration schedule at inference, which uses a single-step integration toreplace the multi-step integration beyond a jump point, to avoid unstable areasaround 1.
