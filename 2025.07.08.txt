AUTHORS: Eric Xing ; Mingkai Deng ; Jinyu Hou ; Zhiting Hu
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: There has been much debate on what aworld model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it.In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune,and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" inpsychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts onworld modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulatingall actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning andacting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for ageneral-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixedcontinuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervisionlearning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN)AGI system enabled by such a model.

HIGHLIGHT: Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhancemodel robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task duringtraining and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, weintroduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT.Unlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized modelarchitecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modalcontrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one.This process enforces alignment between the learned representations of bothmodels, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving theintrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semanticallymeaningful updates at test-time.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce PointAMaLR, a novelself-supervised learning framework that enhances feature representation andprocessing accuracy through attention-guided multi-scale local reconstruction.PointAMaLR implements hierarchical reconstruction across multiple localregions, with lower layers focusing on fine-scale feature restoration whileupper layers address coarse-scale feature reconstruction, thereby enablingcomplex inter-patch interactions.

HIGHLIGHT: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often suffer from an extremelong-tail distribution of dialogue data, causing a strong bias towardhead-frequency blockbusters that sacrifices diversity and exacerbates thecold-start problem. An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIALcorpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of allmentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.This imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, bodyrepresentation drift, and tail sparsity.

To tackle these problems, we propose anovel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improvedsurvival prediction.

HIGHLIGHT: Therefore, high-performance semantic segmentation models offer asolution by providing clear postoperative analyses of surgical procedures.However, recent advanced segmentation models rely on user-generated prompts,rendering them impractical for lengthy surgical videos that commonly exceed anhour. To address this challenge, we introduce Surg-SegFormer, a novelprompt-free model that outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques.Surg-SegFormer attained a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.80 on theEndoVis2018 dataset and 0.54 on the EndoVis2017 dataset.
