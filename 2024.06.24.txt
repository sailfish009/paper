AUTHORS: Yanran Chen ; Hannes Gr�ner ; Sina Zarrie� ; Steffen Eger

HIGHLIGHT: While most previous research has focused on forms of the Turing test when evaluating automatic poetry generation - can humans distinguish between automatic and human generated poetry - we evaluate the diversity of automatically generated poetry, by comparing distributions of generated poetry to distributions of human poetry along structural, lexical, semantic and stylistic dimensions, assessing different model types (word vs. character-level, general purpose LLMs vs. poetry-specific models), including the very recent LLaMA3, and types of fine-tuning (conditioned vs. unconditioned). We find that current automatic poetry systems are considerably underdiverse along multiple dimensions - they often do not rhyme sufficiently, are semantically too uniform and even do not match the length distribution of human poetry.

HIGHLIGHT: we observed a temporary performance drop at the beginning, followed by a recovery phase, a phenomenon known as the "stability gap," previously noted in vision models classifying new classes. To address this issue and enhance LLM performance within a fixed compute budget, we propose three effective strategies: (1) Continually pre-training the LLM on a subset with a proper size for multiple epochs, resulting in faster performance recovery than pre-training the LLM on a large corpus in a single epoch; (2) Pre-training the LLM only on high-quality sub-corpus, which rapidly boosts domain performance; and (3) Using a data mixture similar to the pre-training data to reduce distribution gap.
