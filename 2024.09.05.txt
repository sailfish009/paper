160, TITLE: Oops, I Sampled It Again: Reinterpreting Confidence Intervals in Few-Shot Learning
AUTHORS: RAPHAEL LAFARGUE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML, 68T06, I.2; I.4; I.5; G.3]
HIGHLIGHT: This makes the CI misleading in that it takes into account the randomness of the sampler but not the data itself. To quantify the extent of this problem, we conduct a comparative analysis between CIs computed with and without replacement.

161, TITLE: Optimal L-Systems for Stochastic L-system Inference Problems
AUTHORS: Ali Lotfi ; Ian McQuillan
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.DS, cs.FL]

163, TITLE: Sharing Analysis in The Pawns Compiler
AUTHORS: Lee Naish
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, D.3.4; D.3.2]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper describes the sharing analysis which allows impurity to be encapsulated.

164, TITLE: Hybrid Imitation-Learning Motion Planner for Urban Driving
AUTHORS: Cristian Gariboldi ; Matteo Corno ; Beng Jin
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Conversely, optimization-based planners offer greater security in short-term planning scenarios. To confront this challenge, in this paper we propose a novel hybrid motion planner that integrates both learning-based and optimization-based techniques.

165, TITLE: Unsupervised Welding Defect Detection Using Audio And Video
AUTHORS: GEORG STEMMER et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV, eess.IV]

166, TITLE: A Low-Cost Real-Time Spiking System for Obstacle Detection Based on Ultrasonic Sensors and Rate Coding
AUTHORS: Alvaro Ayuso-Martinez ; Daniel Casanueva-Morato ; Juan Pedro Dominguez-Morales ; Angel Jimenez-Fernandez ; Gabriel Jimenez-Moreno
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: It has also been a subject of study in neuroscience, where flying insects and bats could be considered two of the most interesting cases in terms of vision-based and sound-based mechanisms for obstacle detection, respectively.

167, TITLE: Detecting Calls to Action in Multimodal Content: Analysis of The 2021 German Federal Election Campaign on Instagram
AUTHORS: Michael Achmann-Denkler ; Jakob Fehle ; Mario Haim ; Christian Wolff
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: This study investigates the automated classification of Calls to Action (CTAs) within the 2021 German Instagram election campaign to advance the understanding of mobilization in social media contexts.

168, TITLE: The Role of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Software Testing
AUTHORS: Ahmed Ramadan ; Husam Yasin ; Burhan Pektas
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Case studies included in this paper illustrate real-world applications of AI and ML in software testing, showing significant improvements in testing efficiency, accuracy, and overall software quality.

169, TITLE: Temporal Order Preserved Optimal Transport-based Cross-modal Knowledge Transfer Learning for ASR
AUTHORS: Xugang Lu ; Peng Shen ; Yu Tsao ; Hisashi Kawai
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.CL, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a Temporal Order Preserved OT (TOT)-based Cross-modal Alignment and Knowledge Transfer (CAKT) (TOT-CAKT) for ASR.

170, TITLE: What Makes A Face Looks Like A Hat: Decoupling Low-level and High-level Visual Properties with Image Triplets
AUTHORS: Maytus Piriyajitakonkij ; Sirawaj Itthipuripat ; Ian Ballard ; Ioannis Pappas
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the impact of low-level features on behavior is less understood partly due to the high correlation between high- and low-level features in the stimuli presented (e.g., objects of the same category are more likely to share low-level features). To disentangle these effects, we propose a method that de-correlates low- and high-level visual properties in a novel set of stimuli.

171, TITLE: Automatic Facial Axes Standardization of 3D Fetal Ultrasound Images

AUTHORS: Ivan Pereira-S�nchez ; Eloi Sans ; Julia Navarro ; Joan Duran
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a model-based deep unfolded method for satellite image fusion.

173, TITLE: CanvOI, An Oncology Intelligence Foundation Model: Scaling FLOPS Differently
AUTHORS: JONATHAN ZALACH et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To address this, digital pathology foundation models have begun to emerge, typically developed with the size and diversity of the pre-training dataset and model parameters in mind. Here, we present CanvOI, a ViT-g/10-based foundation model designed to enhance the capabilities of digital pathology by addressing these challenges through a different approach.
