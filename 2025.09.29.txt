AUTHORS: PEDRO MIZUNO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.NI [cs.NI, cs.OS, cs.PL, C.2.2; C.2.3; D.3.3]
HIGHLIGHT: Transport protocols are fundamental to network communications, continuouslyevolving to meet the demands of new applications, workloads, and networkarchitectures while running in a wide range of execution environments (a.k.atargets). We argue that this diversity across protocols and targets calls for ahigh-level, target-agnostic programming abstraction for the transport layer.Specifically, we propose to specify transport protocols as high-level programsthat take an event and flow state as input, and using constrained C-likeconstructs, produce the updated state along with target-agnostic instructionsfor key transport operations such as data reassembly, packet generation andscheduling, and timer manipulations.
