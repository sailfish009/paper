AUTHORS: XINGLONG ZHANG et. al.
SOURCE: Machines
HIGHLIGHT: However, in complex visual environments, shifted window attention mechanisms exhibit inherent limitations: although computationally efficient, local window constraints impede cross-region semantic integration, while deep feature processing obstructs robust representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose DAR-Swin (Dual-Attention Revamped Swin Transformer), enhancing the framework through two complementary attention mechanisms.  [Save to Library]
