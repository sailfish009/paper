To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{Marvel}, a novel framework for O2O safe RL, comprising two key components that work in concert: \emph{Value Pre-Alignment} to align the Q-functions with the underlying truth before online learning, and \emph{Adaptive PID Control} to effectively adjust the Lagrange multipliers during online finetuning.

248, TITLE: Epoch-based Application of Problem-Aware Operators in A Multiobjective Memetic Algorithm for Portfolio Optimization
AUTHORS: Feijoo Colomine Dur�n ; Carlos Cotta ; Antonio J. Fern�ndez-Leiva
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: We consider the issue of intensification/diversification balance in the context of a memetic algorithm for the multiobjective optimization of investment portfolios with cardinality constraints. We approach this issue in this work by considering the selective application of knowledge-augmented operators (local search and a memory of elite solutions) based on the search epoch in which the algorithm finds itself, hence alternating between unbiased search (guided uniquely by the built-in search mechanics of the algorithm) and focused search (intensified by the use of the problem-aware operators).
