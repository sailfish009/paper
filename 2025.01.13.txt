91, TITLE: Deep Reversible Consistency Learning for Cross-modal Retrieval
AUTHORS: Ruitao Pu ; Yang Qin ; Dezhong Peng ; Xiaomin Song ; Huiming Zheng

To address these issues, we propose a novel method termed Deep Reversible Consistency Learning (DRCL) for cross-modal retrieval.

AUTHORS: Anna Marklov� ; Ji?� Mili?ka ; Leonid Ryvkin ; ?udmila Lackov� Bennet ; Libu?e Korman�kov�

This study addresses this hypothesis by having GPT-4 generate highly iconic pseudowords in artificial languages.
