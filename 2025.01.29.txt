155, TITLE: Governing The Agent-to-Agent Economy of Trust Via Progressive Decentralization
AUTHORS: Tomer Jordi Chaffer
CATEGORY: cs.MA [cs.MA, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper is a call for a collective exploration of cryptoeconomic incentives, which can help design decentralized governance systems that allow AI agents to autonomously interact and exchange value while ensuring human oversight via progressive decentralization. Toward this end, I propose a research agenda to address the question of agent-to-agent trust using AgentBound Tokens, which are non-transferable, non-fungible tokens uniquely tied to individual AI agents, akin to Soulbound tokens for humans in Web3.

156, TITLE: ASTRAL: Automated Safety Testing of Large Language Models
AUTHORS: Miriam Ugarte ; Pablo Valle ; Jos� Antonio Parejo ; Sergio Segura ; Aitor Arrieta
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present ASTRAL, a tool that automates the generation and execution of test cases (i.e., prompts) for testing the safety of LLMs.

157, TITLE: Three-Dimensional Diffusion-Weighted Multi-Slab MRI With Slice Profile Compensation Using Deep Energy Model
AUTHORS: Reza Ghorbani ; Jyothi Rikhab Chand ; Chu-Yu Lee ; Mathews Jacob ; Merry Mani
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a regularized slab profile encoding (PEN) method within a Plug-and-Play ADMM framework, incorporating multi-scale energy (MuSE) regularization to effectively improve the slab combined reconstruction.

158, TITLE: A Hybrid Deep Learning CNN Model for Enhanced COVID-19 Detection from Computed Tomography (CT) Scan Images
AUTHORS: SURESH BABU NETTUR et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This study proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model for detecting COVID-19 from CT scan images, designed to assist overburdened medical professionals.

159, TITLE: Ultra-high Resolution Multimodal MRI Dense Labelled Holistic Brain Atlas
AUTHORS: JOS� V. MANJ�N et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we introduce holiAtlas, a holistic, multimodal and high-resolution human brain atlas.
