158, TITLE: Towards A Distributed Federated Learning Aggregation Placement Using Particle Swarm Intelligence
AUTHORS: Amir Ali-Pour ; Sadra Bekrani ; Laya Samizadeh ; Julien Gascon-Samson
CATEGORY: cs.DC [cs.DC, cs.LG, cs.NE, cs.NI]
HIGHLIGHT: To optimally perform distributed aggregation in SDFL with minimal reliance on systematic data, we propose Flag-Swap, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method that optimizes the aggregation placement according only to the processing delay.

159, TITLE: Cyberoception: Finding A Painlessly-Measurable New Sense in The Cyberworld Towards Emotion-Awareness in Computing
AUTHORS: TADASHI OKOSHI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.HC [cs.HC, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This study aims to determine other forms of data that can explain users' interoceptive or similar states in their real-world lives and propose a novel hypothetical concept "cyberoception," a new sense (1) which has properties similar to interoception in terms of the correlation with other emotion-related abilities, and (2) which can be measured only by the sensors embedded inside commodity smartphone devices in users' daily lives.

160, TITLE: Exploring Human-SAV Interaction Using Large Language Models: The Impact of Psychological Ownership and Anthropomorphism on User Experience
AUTHORS: Lirui Guo ; Michael G. Burke ; Wynita M. Griggs
CATEGORY: cs.HC [cs.HC, cs.AI, cs.ET]
HIGHLIGHT: However, limited research has been conducted on how prompt strategies in large language model (LLM)-powered SAV User Interfaces (UIs) affect users' perceptions, experiences, and intentions to adopt such technology. In this work, we investigate how conversational UIs powered by LLMs drive these psychological factors and psychological ownership, the sense of possession a user may come to feel towards an entity or object they may not legally own.

161, TITLE: Quality of Explanation of XAI from The Prespective of Italian End-users: Italian Version of System Causability Scale (SCS)
AUTHORS: Carmine Attanasio ; Alireza Mortezapour
CATEGORY: cs.HC [cs.HC, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: The purpose of the present study is to validate the Italian version of system causability scale (I-SCS) to measure the quality of explanations provided in a xAI.

162, TITLE: Gradient-Optimized Fuzzy Classifier: A Benchmark Study Against State-of-the-Art Models
AUTHORS: Magnus Sieverding ; Nathan Steffen ; Kelly Cohen
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents a performance benchmarking study of a Gradient-Optimized Fuzzy Inference System (GF) classifier against several state-of-the-art machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.

163, TITLE: An Automated Pipeline for Few-Shot Bird Call Classification: A Case Study with The Tooth-Billed Pigeon
AUTHORS: ABHISHEK JANA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents an automated one-shot bird call classification pipeline designed for rare species absent from large publicly available classifiers like BirdNET and Perch.

164, TITLE: IsaBIL: A Framework for Verifying (In)correctness of Binaries in Isabelle/HOL (Extended Version)
AUTHORS: Matt Griffin ; Brijesh Dongol ; Azalea Raad
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents IsaBIL, a binary analysis framework in Isabelle/HOL that is based on the widely used Binary Analysis Platform (BAP).

165, TITLE: Harden and Catch for Just-in-Time Assured LLM-Based Software Testing: Open Research Challenges
AUTHORS: Mark Harman ; Peter O'Hearn ; Shubho Sengupta
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We enumerate possible outcomes for hardening and catching tests and JiTTests, and discuss open research problems, deployment options, and initial results from our work on automated LLM-based hardening at Meta.

166, TITLE: Mining Software Repositories for Expert Recommendation
AUTHORS: Chad Marshall ; Andrew Barovic ; Armin Moin
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose an automated approach to bug assignment to developers in large open-source software projects.

167, TITLE: TinyML for Speech Recognition
AUTHORS: Andrew Barovic ; Armin Moin
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: We train and deploy a quantized 1D convolutional neural network model to conduct speech recognition on a highly resource-constrained IoT edge device.
