AUTHORS: Yuxiang He; Jian Zhao; Yuchen Yuan; Tianle Zhang; Wei Cai; Haojie Cheng; Ziyan Shi; Ming Zhu; Haichuan Tang; Chi Zhang; Xuelong Li
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Current moderation systems, often based on single models or fixed pipelines, exhibit limitations in identifying implicit risks and providing interpretable judgment processes. To address these issues, we propose Aetheria, a multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration.Employing a collaborative architecture of five core agents, Aetheria conducts in-depth analysis and adjudication of multimodal content through a dynamic, mutually persuasive debate mechanism, which is grounded by RAG-based knowledge retrieval.Comprehensive experiments on our proposed benchmark (AIR-Bench) validate that Aetheria not only generates detailed and traceable audit reports but also demonstrates significant advantages over baselines in overall content safety accuracy, especially in the identification of implicit risks.

To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation.

AUTHORS: Xianbing Sun; Zhikai Zhu; Zhengyu Lou; Bo Yang; Jinyang Tang; Liqing Zhang; He Wang; Jianfu Zhang

HIGHLIGHT: Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component.

Guided by these insights, we introduce RESP, a self-reflective structured pruning framework that aligns pruning decisions with the model's reasoning dynamics through self-generated calibration, decode-only gradient-based importance estimation, and progressive regeneration that maintains calibration fidelity as sparsity increases.

To address this gap, we introduce Pianist Transformer, with four key contributions: 1) a unified Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) data representation for learning the shared principles of musical structure and expression without explicit annotation; 2) an efficient asymmetric architecture, enabling longer contexts and faster inference without sacrificing rendering quality; 3) a self-supervised pre-training pipeline with 10B tokens and 135M-parameter model, unlocking data and model scaling advantages for expressive performance rendering; 4) a state-of-the-art performance model, which achieves strong objective metrics and human-level subjective ratings.

In this paper, we identify and empirically validate this phenomenon in UMGMs and provide a theoretical explanation rooted in gradient conflict between modalities.

211, TITLE: PolarGuide-GSDR: 3D Gaussian Splatting Driven By Polarization Priors and Deferred Reflection for Real-World Reflective Scenes
AUTHORS: Derui Shan; Qian Qiao; Hao Lu; Tao Du; Peng Lu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation.

To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem.
