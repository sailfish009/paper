HIGHLIGHT: Identifying subject-specific Hill-type musclemodel parameters and bone dynamic parameters is essential for a personalizedmusculoskeletal model, but very challenging due to the difficulty of measuringthe internal biomechanical variables in vivo directly, especially the jointtorques. In this paper, we propose using Differentiable MusculoSkeletal Model(Diff-MSM) to simultaneously identify its muscle and bone parameters with anend-to-end automatic differentiation technique differentiating from themeasurable muscle activation, through the joint torque, to the resultingobservable motion without the need to measure the internal joint torques.Through extensive comparative simulations, the results manifested that ourproposed method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art baselinemethods, especially in terms of accurate estimation of the muscle parameters(i.e., initial guess sampled from a normal distribution with the mean being theground truth and the standard deviation being 10% of the ground truth could endup with an average of the percentage errors of the estimated values as low as0.05%).

166, TITLE: Generics and Default Reasoning in Large Language Models
AUTHORS: James Ravi Kirkpatrick ; Rachel Katharine Sterken
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LO]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) toreason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, andcognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviourand their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoningproblems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, butchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracyin zero-shot condition, temperature 0).

179, TITLE: Color Spike Data Generation Via Bio-inspired Neuron-like Encoding with An Artificial Photoreceptor Layer
AUTHORS: Hsieh Ching-Teng ; Wang Yuan-Kai

HIGHLIGHT: However, theperformance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by trainingthem with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates fromthe original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-basedinformation processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-likeEncoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operationalprinciples and functions of biological neurons.
