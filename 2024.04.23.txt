1, TITLE: The Instruction Hierarchy: Training LLMs to Prioritize Privileged Instructions
AUTHORS: ERIC WALLACE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CR [cs.CR, cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Today's LLMs are susceptible to prompt injections, jailbreaks, and other attacks that allow adversaries to overwrite a model's original instructions with their own malicious prompts. In this work, we argue that one of the primary vulnerabilities underlying these attacks is that LLMs often consider system prompts (e.g., text from an application developer) to be the same priority as text from untrusted users and third parties.

167, TITLE: Boter: Bootstrapping Knowledge Selection and Question Answering for Knowledge-based VQA
AUTHORS: Dongze Hao ; Qunbo Wang ; Longteng Guo ; Jie Jiang ; Jing Liu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While these methods have demonstrated commendable performance in the task, they possess limitations: (1) they employ an independent retriever to acquire knowledge solely based on the similarity between the query and knowledge embeddings, without assessing whether the knowledge document is truly conducive to helping answer the question; (2) they convert the image into text and then conduct retrieval and answering in natural language space, which may not ensure comprehensive acquisition of all image information. To address these limitations, we propose Boter, a novel framework designed to bootstrap knowledge selection and question answering by leveraging the robust multimodal perception capabilities of the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM).
