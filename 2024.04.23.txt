1, TITLE: The Instruction Hierarchy: Training LLMs to Prioritize Privileged Instructions
AUTHORS: ERIC WALLACE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CR [cs.CR, cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Today's LLMs are susceptible to prompt injections, jailbreaks, and other attacks that allow adversaries to overwrite a model's original instructions with their own malicious prompts. In this work, we argue that one of the primary vulnerabilities underlying these attacks is that LLMs often consider system prompts (e.g., text from an application developer) to be the same priority as text from untrusted users and third parties.

AUTHORS: Dongze Hao ; Qunbo Wang ; Longteng Guo ; Jie Jiang ; Jing Liu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]

With the help of conditional generative adversarial networks, we propose to solve this age-old problem in a different way; we aim to learn a prediction function whose outputs, when paired with the corresponding inputs, are indistinguishable from feature-label pairs in the training dataset.
