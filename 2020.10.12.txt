72, TITLE:      Faster Smarter Induction in Isabelle/HOL with SeLFiE
http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09215

COMMENTS:       SeLFiE: Semantic-aware Logical Feature Extractor

HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we present SeLFiE, a domain-specific language to encode experienced users' expertise on how to apply the induct tactic in Isabelle/HOL: when we apply an induction heuristic written in SeLFiE to an inductive problem and arguments to the induct tactic, the SeLFiE interpreter examines both the syntactic structure of the problem and semantics of the relevant constants to judge whether the arguments to the induct tactic are plausible according to the heuristic.
