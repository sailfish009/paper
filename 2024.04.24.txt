CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We define this task as "language-based scene-retrieval" and it is closely related to "coarse-localization," but we are instead searching for a match from a collection of disjoint scenes and not necessarily a large-scale continuous map. Therefore, we present Text2SceneGraphMatcher, a "scene-retrieval" pipeline that learns joint embeddings between text descriptions and scene graphs to determine if they are matched.

156, TITLE: UVMap-ID: A Controllable and Personalized UV Map Generative Model
AUTHORS: WEIJIE WANG et. al.

To work around this limitation and verify usability, we propose an Unsupervised Forward-Forward algorithm.

To alleviate these challenges, we present a pipeline that: (1) leverages Quality Diversity algorithms like MAP-Elites to create a dataset of many single-task/single-morphology teacher controllers, then (2) distills those diverse controllers into a single multi-morphology controller that performs well across many different body plans by mimicking the sensory-action patterns of the teacher controllers via supervised learning.
