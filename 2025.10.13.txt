CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance onan increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, currentevaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their finalanswers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to thoseanswers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark thatintroduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks.
