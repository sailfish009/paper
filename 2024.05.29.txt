221, TITLE: Sparsity- and Hybridity-Inspired Visual Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Medical Diagnosis
AUTHORS: Mingyuan Liu ; Lu Xu ; Shengnan Liu ; Jicong Zhang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The success of Large Vision Models (LVMs) is accompanied by vast data volumes, which are prohibitively expensive in medical diagnosis.To address this, recent efforts exploit Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), which trains a small number of weights while freezing the rest.However, they typically assign trainable weights to the same positions in LVMs in a heuristic manner, regardless of task differences, making them suboptimal for professional applications like medical diagnosis.To address this, we statistically reveal the nature of sparsity and hybridity during diagnostic-targeted fine-tuning, i.e., a small portion of key weights significantly impacts performance, and these key weights are hybrid, including both task-specific and task-agnostic parts.Based on this, we propose a novel Sparsity- and Hybridity-inspired Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (SH-PEFT).

HIGHLIGHT: Towards this end, we study the sampling requirements for recovery of a continuous domain image from its low-pass Fourier coefficients by fitting a single hidden-layer INR with ReLU activation and a Fourier features layer using a generalized form of weight decay regularization. Our key insight is to relate minimizers of this non-convex parameter space optimization problem to minimizers of a convex penalty defined over an infinite-dimensional space of measures.
