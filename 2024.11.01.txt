88, TITLE: Sequential Order-Robust Mamba for Time Series Forecasting
AUTHORS: Seunghan Lee ; Juri Hong ; Kibok Lee ; Taeyoung Park

To address this issue, we propose SOR-Mamba, a TS forecasting method that 1) incorporates a regularization strategy to minimize the discrepancy between two embedding vectors generated from data with reversed channel orders, thereby enhancing robustness to channel order, and 2) eliminates the 1D-convolution originally designed to capture local information in sequential data.
