AUTHORS: Shouren Wang; Wang Yang; Xianxuan Long; Qifan Wang; Vipin Chaudhary; Xiaotian Han

223, TITLE: VISaGE: Understanding Visual Generics and Exceptions
AUTHORS: Stella Frank; Emily Allaway
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: When evaluation instances are atypical, thisparadigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is apragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arisingfrom VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior thatthe conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category.In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a newevaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images.In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understandingdegrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior isviolated with incongruent images.

241, TITLE: Study on Fuzzy PID Control with An Improved Genetic Algorithm for Boiler Drum Water Level
AUTHORS: Mengmeng Jin; Long Wang; Yongbin Lai; Wenchao Zhang
CATEGORY: Engineering Research Express [ENGINEERING RESEARCH EXPRESS]
HIGHLIGHT: However, traditional fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers suffer from deficiencies such as inadequate dynamic performance and weak interference resistance, making them ill-suited for complex operational conditions; while PID controllers optimized using conventional genetic algorithms (GA) can improve certain performance metrics, they often fall into the trap of ‘over-optimizing a single metric at the expense of overall performance balance’ (such as reducing regulation time while causing overshoot), and their convergence speed remains suboptimal. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Improved Genetic Algorithm (IGA)-optimized Fuzzy PID controller (IGA-Fuzzy PID), which integrates the advantages of Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) and IGA to achieve synergistic optimization of the system’s overall performance.
