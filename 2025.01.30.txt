120, TITLE: Iso-Recursive Multiparty Sessions and Their Automated Verification -- Technical Report
AUTHORS: Marco Giunti ; Nobuko Yoshida
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: This is a problem because: (1) the mechanisation of GMST and equi-recursion in proof assistants is utterly complex and eventually requires co-induction; and (2) the implementation of GMST in type checkers relies on model checkers for environment verification, and thus the program analysis is not self-contained. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by providing an iso-recursive typing system that computes the behavioural properties of environments.
