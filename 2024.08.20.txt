AUTHORS: YADONG LU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite recent progress in enhancing the efficacy of Open-Domain Continual Learning (ODCL) in Vision-Language Models (VLM), failing to (1) correctly identify the Task-ID of a test image and (2) use only the category set corresponding to the Task-ID, while preserving the knowledge related to each domain, cannot address the two primary challenges of ODCL: forgetting old knowledge and maintaining zero-shot capabilities, as well as the confusions caused by category-relatedness between domains. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution: leveraging intra-domain category-aware prototypes for ODCL in CLIP (DPeCLIP), where the prototype is the key to bridging the above two processes.
