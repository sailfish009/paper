HIGHLIGHT: This study systematically evaluates 27 frontier Large Language Models on eight diverse biology benchmarks spanning molecular biology, genetics, cloning, virology, and biosecurity.

155, TITLE: Wasserstein Distances Made Explainable: Insights Into Dataset Shifts and Transport Phenomena
AUTHORS: Philip Naumann ; Jacob Kauffmann ; Gr�goire Montavon
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a novel solution based on Explainable AI that allows us to efficiently and accurately attribute Wasserstein distances to various data components, including data subgroups, input features, or interpretable subspaces.

156, TITLE: Minimal Sequent Calculus for Teaching First-Order Logic: Lessons Learned
AUTHORS: J�rgen Villadsen
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.AI, F.4; I.2.3; K.3.1]
HIGHLIGHT: We present the lessons learned using the tool in recent years at our university.

157, TITLE: GNU Aris: A Web Application for Students
AUTHORS: Saksham Attri ; Zolt�n Kov�cs ; Aaron Windischbauer
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.PL, cs.SE]
HIGHLIGHT: In the report we summarize the user feedback of university students given during a course on logic.

158, TITLE: Ohana Trees and Taylor Expansion for The $?$I-calculus. No Variable Gets Left Behind or Forgotten!
AUTHORS: R�my Cerda ; Giulio Manzonetto ; Alexis Saurin
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.PL, F.4.2; F.3.1]
HIGHLIGHT: The goal of this paper is to introduce a previously unknown theory of the $\lambda$I-calculus, induced by a notion of evaluation trees that we call "Ohana trees".

159, TITLE: A Noise-Resilient Semi-Supervised Graph Autoencoder for Overlapping Semantic Community Detection
AUTHORS: Abdelfateh Bekkair ; Slimane Bellaouar ; Slimane Oulad-Naoui
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Community detection in networks with overlapping structures remains a significant challenge, particularly in noisy real-world environments where integrating topology, node attributes, and prior information is critical. To address this, we propose a semi-supervised graph autoencoder that combines graph multi-head attention and modularity maximization to robustly detect overlapping communities.

160, TITLE: S2MNet: Speckle-To-Mesh Net for Three-Dimensional Cardiac Morphology Reconstruction Via Echocardiogram
AUTHORS: XILIN GONG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While three-dimensional echocardiography exists, it often suffers from reduced resolution, limited availability, and higher acquisition costs. To overcome these challenges, we propose a deep learning framework S2MNet that reconstructs continuous and high-fidelity 3D heart models by integrating six slices of routinely acquired 2D echocardiogram views.
