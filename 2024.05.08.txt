165, TITLE: FedStale: Leveraging Stale Client Updates in Federated Learning
AUTHORS: Angelo Rodio ; Giovanni Neglia
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Yet, this paper shows that, when some clients participate much less than others, aggregating updates with different levels of staleness can detrimentally affect the training process. Motivated by this observation, we introduce FedStale, a novel algorithm that updates the global model in each round through a convex combination of "fresh" updates from participating clients and "stale" updates from non-participating ones.

166, TITLE: Relating-Up: Advancing Graph Neural Networks Through Inter-Graph Relationships
AUTHORS: Qi Zou ; Na Yu ; Daoliang Zhang ; Wei Zhang ; Rui Gao
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]

Recognizing the potential to extend this capability, we introduce Relating-Up, a plug-and-play module that enhances GNNs by exploiting inter-graph relationships.

167, TITLE: Revisiting Character-level Adversarial Attacks
AUTHORS: Elias Abad Rocamora ; Yongtao Wu ; Fanghui Liu ; Grigorios G. Chrysos ; Volkan Cevher

HIGHLIGHT: While character-level attacks easily maintain semantics, they have received less attention as they cannot easily adopt popular gradient-based methods, and are thought to be easy to defend. Challenging these beliefs, we introduce Charmer, an efficient query-based adversarial attack capable of achieving high attack success rate (ASR) while generating highly similar adversarial examples.

AUTHORS: Caelin Kaplan ; Tareq Si Salem ; Angelo Rodio ; Chuan Xu ; Giovanni Neglia

HIGHLIGHT: Yet, traditional training methods have overlooked the operational dynamics of CISs during inference, particularly the potential high heterogeneity in serving rates across clients. To address this gap, we propose a novel FL approach designed explicitly for use in CISs that accounts for these variations in serving rates.
