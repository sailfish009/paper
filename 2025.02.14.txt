HIGHLIGHT: To this end, in this work, we tap into a non-utilized property of conditional flow-based models: the ability to design a non-trivial prior distribution.

236, TITLE: Shortcut Learning Susceptibility in Vision Classifiers
AUTHORS: Pirzada Suhail ; Amit Sethi
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Vision classifiers such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Vision Transformers (ViTs) leverage distinct architectural principles to process spatial and structural information, making them differently susceptible to shortcut learning. In this study, we systematically evaluate these architectures by introducing deliberate shortcuts into the dataset that are positionally correlated with class labels, creating a controlled setup to assess whether models rely on these artificial cues or learn actual distinguishing features.

237, TITLE: Neural Spatiotemporal Point Processes: Trends and Challenges
AUTHORS: SUMANTRAK MUKHERJEE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Consequently, the fusion of neural methods with STPPs has become an active and rapidly evolving research area. In this review, we categorize existing approaches, unify key design choices, and explain the challenges of working with this data modality.

238, TITLE: Graphical Conditions for The Existence, Unicity and Number of Regular Models
AUTHORS: Van-Giang Trinh ; Belaid Benhamou ; Sylvain Soliman ; Franï¿½ois Fages
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.AI, cs.DM]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we explore graphical conditions on the dependency graph of a finite ground normal logic program to analyze the existence, unicity and number of regular models for the program.

239, TITLE: Abduction of Domain Relationships from Data for VQA
AUTHORS: Al Mehdi Saadat Chowdhury ; Paulo Shakarian ; Gerardo I. Simari
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we study the problem of visual question answering (VQA) where the image and query are represented by ASP programs that lack domain data.

240, TITLE: Data2Concept2Text: An Explainable Multilingual Framework for Data Analysis Narration
AUTHORS: Flavio Bertini ; Alessandro Dal Palï¿½ ; Federica Zaglio ; Francesco Fabiano ; Andrea Formisano
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents a complete explainable system that interprets a set of data, abstracts the underlying features and describes them in a natural language of choice.

241, TITLE: Efficient OWL2QL Meta-reasoning Using ASP-based Hybrid Knowledge Bases
AUTHORS: Haya Majid Qureshi ; Wolfgang Faber
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.AI, cs.SC]
HIGHLIGHT: Preliminary work showed that the approach works, but the hoped-for performance improvements were not observed yet. In this work we expand on this body of work by improving the theoretical basis of the reductions and by using alternative tools that show competitive performance.

242, TITLE: Architecture for Simulating Behavior Mode Changes in Norm-Aware Autonomous Agents
AUTHORS: Sean Glaze ; Daniela Inclezan
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.AI, D.1.6; D.3]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents an architecture for simulating the actions of a norm-aware intelligent agent whose behavior with respect to norm compliance is set, and can later be changed, by a human controller.

243, TITLE: Relating Answer Set Programming and Many-sorted Logics for Formal Verification
AUTHORS: Zachary Hansen
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.AI, cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: My research agenda has been focused on addressing these three issues with the intention of making ASP verification an accessible, routine task that is regularly performed alongside program development. In this vein, I have investigated alternative semantics for ASP based on translations into the logic of here-and-there and many-sorted first-order logic.

244, TITLE: Logical Foundations of Smart Contracts
AUTHORS: Kalonji Kalala
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This thesis proposes logical foundations to smart contracts using the Situation Calculus, a logic for reasoning about actions.

245, TITLE: Predicting Drive Test Results in Mobile Networks Using Optimization Techniques
AUTHORS: MohammadJava Taheri ; Abolfazl Diyanat ; MortezaAli Ahmadi ; Ali Nazari
CATEGORY: cs.NI [cs.NI, cs.AI, cs.SE]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we propose a method that enables operators to predict received signal strength at specific locations using data from other drive test points.

246, TITLE: A Prolog Program for Bottom-up Evaluation
AUTHORS: David S. Warren
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.DB, cs.LO]
HIGHLIGHT: This short paper describes a simple and intuitive Prolog program, a metainterpreter, that computes the bottom up meaning of a simple positive Horn clause definition.

247, TITLE: Acoustic Wave Manipulation Through Sparse Robotic Actuation
AUTHORS: Tristan Shah ; Noam Smilovich ; Samer Gerges ; Feruza Amirkulova ; Stas Tiomkin
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we explore a more general problem: the manipulation of acoustic waves, which are partially observed by a robot capable of influencing the waves through spatially sparse actuators.

248, TITLE: Metamorphic Testing for Pose Estimation Systems
AUTHORS: Matias Duran ; Thomas Laurent ; Ellen Rushe ; Anthony Ventresque
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This problem is exacerbated by the fact that different applications require systems to focus on different subjects (e.g., human versus animal) or landmarks (e.g., only extremities versus whole body and face), which makes labelled test data rarely reusable. To combat these problems we propose MET-POSE, a metamorphic testing framework for pose estimation systems that bypasses the need for manual annotation while assessing the performance of these systems under different circumstances.
