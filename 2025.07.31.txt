AUTHORS: Leandro Farina ; Sergey Korotov
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NA, math.NA, 15B48, 68T07, 15A18, 62G32, I.2.6; I.5.2; G.1.3]
HIGHLIGHT: By saliency methods, such as integrated gradients, we identify amongall features, two matrix parameters which alone provide sufficient informationfor the matrix classification, with $95\%$ accuracy, namely the absolute valuesof the two lowest-order coefficients, $c_0$ and $c_1$ of the matrix'scharacteristic polynomial.

152, TITLE: Towards Interpretable Renal Health Decline Forecasting Via Multi-LMM Collaborative Reasoning Framework
AUTHORS: PENG-YI WU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.MA, stat.AP]
HIGHLIGHT: Inthis study, we propose a collaborative framework that enhances the performanceof open-source LMMs for eGFR forecasting while generating clinically meaningfulexplanations.

153, TITLE: Teaching The Teacher: Improving Neural Network Distillability for Symbolic Regression Via Jacobian Regularization
AUTHORS: Soumyadeep Dhar ; Kei Sen Fong ; Mehul Motani
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However,this process is often brittle, as the complex functions learned by standardnetworks are poor targets for symbolic discovery, resulting in low-fidelitystudent models. In this work, we propose a novel training paradigm to addressthis challenge.

154, TITLE: FGFP: A Fractional Gaussian Filter and Pruning for Deep Neural Networks Compression
AUTHORS: Kuan-Ting Tu ; Po-Hsien Yu ; Yu-Syuan Tseng ; Shao-Yi Chien
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While many methods compress neural networkparameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. Toaddress this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP)framework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussianfunction to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs).

155, TITLE: Towards Simulating Social Influence Dynamics with LLM-based Multi-agents
AUTHORS: HSIEN-TSUNG LIN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.MA [cs.MA, cs.AI, cs.CY]
HIGHLIGHT: We investigate whether LLM-basedmulti-agent simulations can reproduce core human social dynamics observed inonline forums.

156, TITLE: Pendulum Model of Spiking Neurons
AUTHORS: Joy Bose
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, q-bio.NC, C.1.3; I.5.1; I.6.3]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a biologically inspired model of spiking neurons based on thedynamics of a damped, driven pendulum.

157, TITLE: A Systematic Literature Review on Detecting Software Vulnerabilities with Large Language Models
AUTHORS: Sabrina Kaniewski ; Fabian Schmidt ; Markus Enzweiler ; Michael Menth ; Tobias Heer
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work,we present a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of LLM-basedsoftware vulnerability detection.

158, TITLE: RePaCA: Leveraging Reasoning Large Language Models for Static Automated Patch Correctness Assessment
AUTHORS: Marcos Fuster-Pena ; David de-Fitero-Dominguez ; Antonio Garcia-Cabot ; Eva Garcia-Lopez
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: It can be solved as a static approach, meaning that noadditional information is needed beyond the original and fixed code snippets.Current static techniques often struggle with reliability, flexibility andtransparency. To address these issues, we introduce RePaCA, a novel static APCAtechnique that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized in thinkingtasks.

159, TITLE: RobEthiChor: Automated Context-aware Ethics-based Negotiation for Autonomous Robots
AUTHORS: Mashal Afzal Memon ; Gianluca Filippone ; Gian Luca Scoccia ; Marco Autili ; Paola Inverardi
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: To address thischallenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomoussystems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors intotheir decision-making through ethics-based negotiation.

160, TITLE: TrAIce3D: A Prompt-Driven Transformer Based U-Net for Semantic Segmentation of Microglial Cells from Large-Scale 3D Microscopy Images
AUTHORS: MohammadAmin Alamalhoda ; Arsalan Firoozi ; Alessandro Venturino ; Sandra Siegert
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: It employs a two-stageapproach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detectssomas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image.
