69, TITLE: ArtVLM: Attribute Recognition Through Vision-Based Prefix Language Modeling
AUTHORS: WILLIAM Y. ZHU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While large vision language representations like CLIP had largely resolved the task of zero-shot object recognition, zero-shot visual attribute recognition remains a challenge because CLIP's contrastively-learned vision-language representation cannot effectively capture object-attribute dependencies. In this paper, we target this weakness and propose a sentence generation-based retrieval formulation for attribute recognition that is novel in 1) explicitly modeling a to-be-measured and retrieved object-attribute relation as a conditional probability graph, which converts the recognition problem into a dependency-sensitive language-modeling problem, and 2) applying a large pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM) on this reformulation and naturally distilling its knowledge of image-object-attribute relations to use towards attribute recognition.

HIGHLIGHT: The emergence of federated learning (FL) presents a promising approach to leverage decentralized data while preserving privacy.

158, TITLE: Detecting Car Speed Using Object Detection and Depth Estimation: A Deep Learning Framework
AUTHORS: Subhasis Dasgupta ; Arshi Naaz ; Jayeeta Choudhury ; Nancy Lahiri
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The current project tries to address the issue of vehicle speed estimation with handheld devices such as mobile phones or wearable cameras with network connection to estimate the speed using deep learning frameworks.

159, TITLE: Assigning Credit with Partial Reward Decoupling in Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization
AUTHORS: Aditya Kapoor ; Benjamin Freed ; Howie Choset ; Jeff Schneider
CATEGORY: cs.MA [cs.MA, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that adapts recent developments in credit assignment to improve upon MAPPO.

160, TITLE: Ownership in Low-level Intermediate Representation
AUTHORS: Siddharth Priya ; Arie Gurfinkel
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.SE, D.2.4]
HIGHLIGHT: For unsafe functionality, memory accesses are modelled by operations on an address map and we provide mechanisms to keep the address map and pointer cache in sync.

161, TITLE: Modelling Probabilistic FPC in Guarded Type Theory
AUTHORS: Philipp Jan Andries Stassen ; Rasmus Ejlers M�gelberg ; Maaike Zwart ; Alejandro Aguirre ; Lars Birkedal
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.LO, F.3.1; F.3.2]
HIGHLIGHT: We show how to define and reason about a programming language with probabilistic choice and recursive types, in guarded type theory.

163, TITLE: Inference with The Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm
AUTHORS: Koulik Khamaru ; Cun-Hui Zhang
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY, math.ST, stat.TH]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we discuss the asymptotic behavior of the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm in the context of multiarmed bandit problems and discuss its implication in downstream inferential tasks.

164, TITLE: Deep Transfer Learning for Kidney Cancer Diagnosis
AUTHORS: YASSINE HABCHI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first comprehensive survey of DL-based TL frameworks for kidney cancer diagnosis.

165, TITLE: Is SAM 2 Better Than SAM in Medical Image Segmentation?
AUTHORS: Sourya Sengupta ; Satrajit Chakrabarty ; Ravi Soni
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we performed extensive studies with multiple datasets from different imaging modalities to compare the performance between SAM and SAM 2.
