95, TITLE: Investigating The 'Autoencoder Behavior' in Speech Self-Supervised Models: A Focus on HuBERT's Pretraining
AUTHORS: Valentin Vielzeuf
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, it has been observed that finetuning all layers of the learned model leads to lower performance compared to resetting top layers. This phenomenon is attributed to the ''autoencoder'' behavior: top layers contain information closer to the input and are less suitable for tasks that require linguistic information, such as Speech Recognition.To better our understanding of this behavior, we propose to study the evolution of high-level information within the model during pretraining.
