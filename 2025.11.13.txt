72, TITLE: AMaPO: Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization for Language Model Alignment
AUTHORS: Ruibo Deng; Duanyu Feng; Wenqiang Lei

To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm.

85, TITLE: Learning By Neighbor-Aware Semantics, Deciding By Open-form Flows: Towards Robust Zero-Shot Skeleton Action Recognition
AUTHORS: Yang Chen; Miaoge Li; Zhijie Rao; Deze Zeng; Song Guo; Jingcai Guo

AUTHORS: Mingjie Zhao; Zhanpei Huang; Yang Lu; Mengke Li; Yiqun Zhang; Weifeng Su; Yiu-ming Cheung
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions.

AUTHORS: Juntu Zhao; Jialing Zhang; Chongxuan Li; Dequan Wang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent closed-source multimodal systems have made great advances, but their hidden language for understanding the world remains opaque because of their black-box architectures. In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence.

HIGHLIGHT: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies.

HIGHLIGHT: The effectiveness of middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization for chronic subdural hematoma is well established,1–3 and distal and multibranch penetration of embolic agents is recognized as a key factor for better outcomes.4 5 In recent years, several studies have described artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted neuroendovascular treatment.6–9 We recently reported that AI-assisted MMA embolization may enhance procedural safety through reflux detection and notification.10 This case (video 1) focuses on the overlay feature, highlighting its potential to improve procedural efficacy by enabling greater distal and multibranch penetration, resulting in a larger embolization volume.

140, TITLE: USF-Net: A Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network for Ground-Based Remote Sensing Cloud Image Sequence Extrapolation
AUTHORS: Penghui Niu; Taotao Cai; Jiashuai She; Yajuan Zhang; Junhua Gua; Ping Zhanga; Jungong Hane; Jianxin Li
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing approaches exhibit several limitations:(1)they primarily rely on static kernels to augment feature information, lacking adaptive mechanisms to extract features at varying resolutions dynamically;(2)temporal guidance is insufficient, leading to suboptimal modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies; and(3)the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms is often overlooked, limiting efficiency in practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network that integrates adaptive large-kernel convolutions and a low-complexity attention mechanism, combining temporal flow information within an encoder-decoder framework.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing methodologies exhibit several limitations:(1)they rely on dilated convolutions for multi-scale context extraction, lacking the partial feature effectiveness and interoperability of inter-channel;(2)attention-based feature enhancement implementations neglect accuracy-throughput balance; and (3)the decoder modifications fail to establish global interdependencies among hierarchical local features, limiting inference efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose MPCM-Net, a Multi-scale network that integrates Partial attention Convolutions with Mamba architectures to enhance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency.

155, TITLE: DFA-YOLO: A Novel YOLO Model for Electric Power Operation Violation Recognition
AUTHORS: Xiaoliang Qian; Xinyu Ding; Pengfei Wang; Jungang Guo; Hu Chen; Wei Wang; Peixu Xing
CATEGORY: Information [INFORMATION]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the current YOLO models still have three limitations: (1) the absence of a dedicated feature extraction for multi-scale objects, resulting in suboptimal detection capabilities for objects with varying sizes; (2) naive integration of spatial and channel attentions, which restricts the enhancement of feature discriminability and consequently impairs the detection performance for challenging objects in complex backgrounds; and (3) weak representation capability in low-level features, leading to insufficient accuracy for small-sized objects. To address these limitations, a novel YOLO model named DFA-YOLO is proposed, a real-time object detection model with YOLOv12n as its baseline, which makes three key contributions. Firstly, a dynamic weighted multi-scale convolution (DWMConv) module is proposed to address the first limitation, which employs lightweight multi-scale convolution followed by learnable weighted fusion to enhance feature representation for multi-scale objects.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components.

Building on research in entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation, we present a framework with three key stages: (1) Imagination shaping, where vague goals become clear value propositions, supported by AI agents that help with market scanning, idea refinement, and rapid concept generation; (2) Reality testing, where these ideas are tested through low-cost experiments, structured feedback loops, and efficient execution, with AI agents automating tasks such as prototyping, content creation, customer interaction, and data analysis; and (3) Reality scaling, where successful ideas are transformed into repeatable processes, scalable market strategies, and long-term business models, increasingly operated and optimized by autonomous or semi-autonomous AI workflows.

AUTHORS: Eric Goles; Pedro Montealegre; Martín Ríos-Wilson; Guillaume Theyssier

To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation.

To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy.
