AUTHORS: Jing Ma; Hanlin Li; Xiang Xiang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Entropy Minimization (EM) is beneficial to reducing class overlap, bridgingdomain gap, and restricting uncertainty for various tasks in machine learning,yet its potential is limited. To study the internal mechanism of EM, wereformulate and decouple the classical EM into two parts with opposite effects:cluster aggregation driving factor (CADF) rewards dominant classes and promptsa peaked output distribution, while gradient mitigation calibrator (GMC)penalizes high-confidence classes based on predicted probabilities.Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of classical EM caused by its coupledformulation: 1) reward collapse impedes the contribution of high-certaintysamples in the learning process, and 2) easy-class bias induces misalignmentbetween output distribution and label distribution.
