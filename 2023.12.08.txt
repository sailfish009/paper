To address these problems, we propose to learn a structured cross-modality latent space to represent pixel features and 3D features via a differentiable probabilistic PnP solver.

163, TITLE: A Low-Overhead Incorporation-Extrapolation Based Few-Shot CSI Feedback Framework for Massive MIMO Systems
AUTHORS: BINGGUI ZHOU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.IT [cs.IT, cs.AI, eess.SP, math.IT]
HIGHLIGHT: Besides, with the rapidly increasing number of antennas and subcarriers, most of these deep learning methods' CSI feedback overhead also grow dramatically, owing to their focus on full-dimensional CSI feedback. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a low-overhead Incorporation-Extrapolation based Few-Shot CSI feedback Framework (IEFSF) for massive MIMO systems.

164, TITLE: Learn to Unlearn for Deep Neural Networks: Minimizing Unlearning Interference with Gradient Projection
AUTHORS: Tuan Hoang ; Santu Rana ; Sunil Gupta ; Svetha Venkatesh
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The challenge of machine unlearning is to discard information about the ``forget'' data in the learnt model without altering the knowledge about the remaining dataset and to do so more efficiently than the naive retraining approach. To achieve this, we adopt a projected-gradient based learning method, named as Projected-Gradient Unlearning (PGU), in which the model takes steps in the orthogonal direction to the gradient subspaces deemed unimportant for the retaining dataset, so as to its knowledge is preserved.

169, TITLE: Adversarial Learning for Feature Shift Detection and Correction
AUTHORS: Miriam Barrabes ; Daniel Mas Montserrat ; Margarita Geleta ; Xavier Giro-i-Nieto ; Alexander G. Ioannidis
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.AP, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: Feature shifts can occur in many datasets, including in multi-sensor data, where some sensors are malfunctioning, or in tabular and structured data, including biomedical, financial, and survey data, where faulty standardization and data processing pipelines can lead to erroneous features. In this work, we explore using the principles of adversarial learning, where the information from several discriminators trained to distinguish between two distributions is used to both detect the corrupted features and fix them in order to remove the distribution shift between datasets.
