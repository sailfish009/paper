154, TITLE: VendiRL: A Framework for Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning of Diversely Diverse Skills
AUTHORS: Erik M. Lintunen
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: For evaluating skill diversity, defining whatconstitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specificnotion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading toinconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results acrossdifferent approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversityunexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversitythat translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity.
