AUTHORS: Kaijia Xu ; Petar Veli?kovi?
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Today, graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in neural algorithmic reasoners due to their message passing framework and permutation equivariance. In this extended abstract, we challenge this design choice, and replace the equivariant aggregation function with a recurrent neural network.

156, TITLE: Online Decision MetaMorphFormer: A Casual Transformer-Based Reinforcement Learning Framework of Universal Embodied Intelligence
AUTHORS: Luo Ji ; Runji Lin
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite there being increasing efforts in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the aid of transformers, most of them might be limited by the offline training pipeline, which prohibits exploration and generalization abilities. To address this limitation, we propose the framework of Online Decision MetaMorphFormer (ODM) which aims to achieve self-awareness, environment recognition, and action planning through a unified model architecture.

161, TITLE: Tuning-Free Online Robust Principal Component Analysis Through Implicit Regularization
AUTHORS: Lakshmi Jayalal ; Gokularam Muthukrishnan ; Sheetal Kalyani
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: The performance of the standard Online Robust Principal Component Analysis (OR-PCA) technique depends on the optimum tuning of the explicit regularizers and this tuning is dataset sensitive. We aim to remove the dependency on these tuning parameters by using implicit regularization.

162, TITLE: Behavioral Cloning Models Reality Check for Autonomous Driving
AUTHORS: Mustafa Yildirim ; Barkin Dagda ; Vinal Asodia ; Saber Fallah
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While numerous vision-based autonomous vehicle systems have been trained and evaluated in simulated environments, there is a notable lack of real-world validation for these systems. This paper addresses this gap by presenting the real-world validation of state-of-the-art perception systems that utilize Behavior Cloning (BC) for lateral control, processing raw image data to predict steering commands.
