AUTHORS: HYEONJEONG HA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While RAG enhances MLLMs by grounding responses in query-relevant external knowledge, this reliance poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where misinformation or irrelevant knowledge is intentionally injected into external knowledge bases to manipulate model outputs to be incorrect and even harmful. To expose such vulnerabilities in multimodal RAG, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, a novel knowledge poisoning attack framework with two attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which injects query-specific misinformation in both text and images for targeted manipulation, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA) to provide false guidance during MLLM generation to elicit nonsensical responses across all queries.

AUTHORS: Jinyuan Fang ; Zaiqiao Meng ; Craig Macdonald
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, their retrieval process faces two key challenges: (1) it can be disrupted by irrelevant documents or factually inaccurate chain-of-thoughts; (2) their retrievers are not designed to dynamically adapt to the evolving information needs in multi-step reasoning, making it difficult to identify and retrieve the missing information required at each iterative step. Therefore, we propose KiRAG, which uses a knowledge-driven iterative retriever model to enhance the retrieval process of iRAG.

162, TITLE: Predicting Through Generation: Why Generation Is Better for Prediction
AUTHORS: MD KOWSHER et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, autoregressive models face two key challenges when used for prediction: (1) exposure bias, where the model sees ground truth tokens during training but relies on its own predictions during inference, leading to errors, and (2) format mismatch, where discrete tokens do not always align with the tasks required output structure. To address these challenges, we introduce PredGen(Predicting Through Generating), an end to end framework that (i) uses scheduled sampling to reduce exposure bias, and (ii) introduces a task adapter to convert the generated tokens into structured outputs.

AUTHORS: Lucy Farnik ; Tim Lawson ; Conor Houghton ; Laurence Aitchison
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: The extent to which SAEs can help us understand computations is unclear because they are not designed to "sparsify" computations in any sense, only latent activations. To solve this, we propose Jacobian SAEs (JSAEs), which yield not only sparsity in the input and output activations of a given model component but also sparsity in the computation (formally, the Jacobian) connecting them.

On the way, we introduce restricted CSPs, i.e., problems of the form CSP$({\mathbb H})$ restricted to yes-instances of CSP$({\mathbb H}')$ -- these were called restricted homomorphism problems by Hell and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il.

AUTHORS: Chiara Lindloff ; Ingo Siegert
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CY]

224, TITLE: Language Models' Factuality Depends on The Language of Inquiry
AUTHORS: TUSHAR AGGARWAL et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: For example, we find that an LM may correctly identify Rashed Al Shashai as being from Saudi Arabia when asked in Arabic, but consistently fails to do so when asked in English or Swahili. To systematically investigate this limitation, we introduce a benchmark of 10,000 country-related facts across 13 languages and propose three novel metrics: Factual Recall Score, Knowledge Transferability Score, and Cross-Lingual Factual Knowledge Transferability Score-to quantify factual recall and knowledge transferability in LMs across different languages.

To address this challenge, we implemented a data-driven approach leveraging Large Language Models and Topic Modelling to uncover and interpret latent experiential topics directly from the Dreamachine's text-based reports.

230, TITLE: Semantics Drives Analogical Change in Germanic Strong Verb Paradigms: A Phylogenetic Study
AUTHORS: Alexandru Craevschi ; Sarah Babinski ; Chundra Cathcart
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: More specifically, it has been observed that in some Germanic languages in which narrative past tense is expressed by the past participle, there is a greater affinity for stem allomorphy shared by preterite forms and past participles to the exclusion of present forms (the so-called ABB pattern), as it serves to enhance marking of the binary semantic opposition between present and past. Using data from 107 cognate verbs attested across 14 archaic and contemporary Germanic languages and a novel hierarchical phylogenetic model, we show that there is a greater long-term preference for this alternation pattern in situations where narrative past tense has been extended to the past participle, confirming this hypothesis.

233, TITLE: Towards Typologically Aware Rescoring to Mitigate Unfaithfulness in Lower-Resource Languages
AUTHORS: Tsan Tsai Chan ; Xin Tong ; Thi Thu Uyen Hoang ; Barbare Tepnadze ; Wojciech Stempniak
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are known to more frequently generate non-faithful output in resource-constrained languages (Guerreiro et al., 2023 - arXiv:2303.16104), potentially because these typologically diverse languages are underrepresented in their training data. To mitigate unfaithfulness in such settings, we propose using computationally light auxiliary models to rescore the outputs of larger architectures.
