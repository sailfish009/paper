CATEGORY: q-bio.QM [q-bio.QM, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Results: To alleviate this major labeling burden, we proposed a Hybrid Active Learning (HAL) framework for querying subtomograms for labelling from a large unlabeled subtomogram pool.

92, TITLE: Multi-Slice Low-Rank Tensor Decomposition Based Multi-Atlas Segmentation: Application to Automatic Pathological Liver CT Segmentation
AUTHORS: Changfa Shi ; Min Xian ; Xiancheng Zhou ; Haotian Wang ; Heng-Da Cheng
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank tensor decomposition (LRTD) based multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) framework that achieves accurate and robust pathological liver segmentation of CT images.
