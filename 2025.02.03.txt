29, TITLE: Rethinking Diffusion Posterior Sampling: From Conditional Score Estimator to Maximizing A Posterior
AUTHORS: TONGDA XU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This assertion is substantiated through an examination of DPS on 512x512 ImageNet images, revealing that: 1) DPS's conditional score estimation significantly diverges from the score of a well-trained conditional diffusion model and is even inferior to the unconditional score; 2) The mean of DPS's conditional score estimation deviates significantly from zero, rendering it an invalid score estimation; 3) DPS generates high-quality samples with significantly lower diversity. In light of the above findings, we posit that DPS more closely resembles MAP than a conditional score estimator, and accordingly propose the following enhancements to DPS: 1) we explicitly maximize the posterior through multi-step gradient ascent and projection; 2) we utilize a light-weighted conditional score estimator trained with only 100 images and 8 GPU hours.

AUTHORS: Ying Wen ; Ziyu Wan ; Shao Zhang
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.MA]

In this paper, we propose language games as a pathway to expanded data reproduction, breaking this cycle through three mechanisms: (1) \textit{role fluidity}, which enhances data diversity and coverage by enabling multi-agent systems to dynamically shift roles across tasks; (2) \textit{reward variety}, embedding multiple feedback criteria that can drive complex intelligent behaviors; and (3) \textit{rule plasticity}, iteratively evolving interaction constraints to foster learnability, thereby injecting continual novelty.

AUTHORS: Mustafa O. Karabag ; Ufuk Topcu
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.GT, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: The empirical results show that while non-chameleon LLM agents identify the chameleon, they fail to conceal the secret from the chameleon, and their winning probability is far from the levels of even trivial strategies. To formally explain this behavior, we give a theoretical analysis for a spectrum of strategies, from concealing to revealing, and provide bounds on the non-chameleons' winning probability.

109, TITLE: Fantastic Targets for Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models and Where To Find Them
AUTHORS: ANH BUI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The common principle of previous works to remove a specific concept is to map it to a fixed generic concept, such as a neutral concept or just an empty text prompt. In this paper, we demonstrate that this fixed-target strategy is suboptimal, as it fails to account for the impact of erasing one concept on the others.

AUTHORS: Frederik Hytting J�rgensen ; Luigi Gresele ; Sebastian Weichwald
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, math.ST, stat.TH]
HIGHLIGHT: For example, to interpret an action as an intervention on a treatment variable, the action will presumably have to a) change the distribution of treatment in a way that corresponds to the intervention, and b) not change other aspects, such as how the outcome depends on the treatment; while the marginal distributions of some variables may change as an effect. We introduce a formal framework to make such requirements for different interpretations of actions as interventions precise.

In this work, we investigate a controlled 2D Gaussian "bump" generation task, demonstrating that standard generative architectures fail in OOD regions when training with partial data, even when supplied with fully disentangled $(x, y)$ coordinates, re-entangling them through subsequent layers.

AUTHORS: Emily Wenger ; Yoed Kenett
CATEGORY: cs.CY [cs.CY, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, these studies only consider the effects of interacting with a single LLM, begging the question of whether such narrowed creativity stems from using a particular LLM -- which arguably has a limited range of outputs -- or from using LLMs in general as creative assistants. To study this question, we elicit creative responses from humans and a broad set of LLMs using standardized creativity tests and compare the population-level diversity of responses.

130, TITLE: Pitfalls of Defacing Whole-head MRI: Re-identification Risk with Diffusion Models and Compromised Research Potential

135, TITLE: Accelerating Diffusion Transformer Via Error-Optimized Cache
AUTHORS: JUNXIANG QIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing caching methods accelerate generation by reusing DiT features from the previous time step and skipping calculations in the next, but they tend to locate and cache low-error modules without focusing on reducing caching-induced errors, resulting in a sharp decline in generated content quality when increasing caching intensity. To solve this problem, we propose the Error-Optimized Cache (EOC).

188, TITLE: PSO-Net: Development of An Automated Psoriasis Assessment System Using Attention-based Interpretable Deep Neural Networks
AUTHORS: SHARIF A. KAMRAN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although, the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is utilized as a standard measurement to assess psoriasis severity in clinical trials, it has many drawbacks such as (1) patient burden for in-person clinic visits for assessment of psoriasis, (2) time required for investigator scoring and (3) variability of inter- and intra-rater scoring. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel and interpretable deep learning architecture called PSO-Net, which maps digital images from different anatomical regions to derive attention-based scores.
