AUTHORS: Yi Zhou; Haohao Qu; Yunqing Liu; Shanru Lin; Le Song; Wenqi Fan

AUTHORS: Daniel A. Herrmann; Abinav Chari; Isabelle Qian; Sree Sharvesh; B. A. Levinstein
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors.

26, TITLE: Evaluating Metrics for Safety with LLM-as-Judges
AUTHORS: Kester Clegg; Richard Hawkins; Ibrahim Habli; Tom Lawton
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]

40, TITLE: EagleVision: A Dual-Stage Framework with BEV-grounding-based Chain-of-Thought for Spatial Intelligence
AUTHORS: Jiaxu Wan; Xu Wang; Mengwei Xie; Hang Zhang; Mu Xu; Yang Han; Hong Zhang; Ding Yuan; Yifan Yang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Frameworks for "thinking with images" (e.g., ChatGPT-o3 and DeepEyes) show that stepwise multimodal reasoning can emerge by interleaving hypothesis formation with active acquisition of visual evidence, but they do not address three key challenges in spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT): building global space perception under strict token budgets, explicitly associating 3D hypotheses with video frames for verification, and designing spatially grounded rewards for reinforcement learning. To address these issues, we present EagleVision, a dual-stage framework for progressive spatial cognition through macro perception and micro verification.

AUTHORS: Rohit Jena; Pratik Chaudhari; James C. Gee
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While the challenge demonstrates that modern deep learning methods achieve competitive accuracy on T1-weighted MRI, it also claims exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen contrasts and resolutions, assertions that contradict established understanding of domain shift in deep learning.

69, TITLE: Toward Expert-level Motivational Interviewing for Health Behavior Improvement with LLMs
AUTHORS: Run-ze Hu; Yang Yang; Yi-hang Yang; Jing-qi Kong; Jia-hui Luo; Wen-yu Yang; Jing Chen; Jing-yao Liu; Hui-qun Zeng; Lei Zhang; Zheng Liu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Results: Across all three models, fine-tuning substantially improved BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores compared with the base models, and manual coding showed that MI-LLMs achieved technical and relational global scores, and MI-adherent ratios that approached those of real MI dialogues, although complex reflections and reflection-to-question ratios remained less frequent. Conclusions: These findings provide initial evidence that MI-oriented fine-tuning can endow general-purpose LLMs with core MI-consistent counseling behaviors, suggesting a scalable pathway toward AI-assisted health behavior change support while underscoring the need for further work on data scale, complex MI skills and real-world intervention trials.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet prevailing science benchmarks probe decontextualized knowledge and overlook the iterative reasoning, hypothesis generation, and observation interpretation that drive scientific discovery. We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled.

81, TITLE: Cross-Tokenizer Likelihood Scoring Algorithms for Language Model Distillation
AUTHORS: Buu Phan; Ashish Khisti; Karen Ullrich
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Since this requires both models to share the same probability space, it becomes challenging when the teacher and student LMs use different tokenizers, for instance, when edge-device deployment necessitates a smaller vocabulary size to lower memory overhead. In this work, we address this vocabulary misalignment problem by uncovering an implicit recursive structure in the commonly deployed Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm and utilizing it to create a probabilistic framework for cross-tokenizer likelihood scoring.

82, TITLE: HERO: Hierarchical Traversable 3D Scene Graphs for Embodied Navigation Among Movable Obstacles
AUTHORS: Yunheng Wang; Yixiao Feng; Yuetong Fang; Shuning Zhang; Tan Jing; Jian Li; Xiangrui Jiang; Renjing Xu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.RO [RO]
HIGHLIGHT: This fundamental limitation severely undermines their effectiveness in real-world scenarios, leading to limited reachability, low efficiency, and inferior extensibility. To address these issues, we propose HERO, a novel framework for constructing Hierarchical Traversable 3DSGs, that redefines traversability by modeling operable obstacles as pathways, capturing their physical interactivity, functional semantics, and the scene's relational hierarchy.

90, TITLE: Robust and Calibrated Detection of Authentic Multimedia Content
AUTHORS: Sarim Hashmi; Abdelrahman Elsayed; Mohammed Talha Alam; Samuele Poppi; Nils Lukas
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable for two reasons: (i) distinguishing inauthentic content post-hoc is often impossible (e.g., with memorized samples), leading to an unbounded false positive rate (FPR); and (ii) detection lacks robustness, as adversaries can adapt to known detectors with near-perfect accuracy using minimal computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied.

CATEGORY: Applied Science and Innovative Research [APPLIED SCIENCE AND INNOVATIVE RESEARCH]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing analytical, CFD, and experimental approaches are limited by operating-condition adaptability, computational burden, and cost, while conventional data-driven methods are prone to initialization sensitivity and entrapment in local optima, resulting in inadequate timeliness and accuracy. To address these issues, this study applies a back-propagation (BP) neural network to water-film pressure estimation and introduces an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) with a sine-decay mechanism to optimize the BP network’s weights and biases, thereby constructing an IGA-BP model.

115, TITLE: Integrating Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs to Capture Political Viewpoints in News Media
AUTHORS: Massimiliano Fadda; Enrico Motta; Francesco Osborne; Diego Reforgiato Recupero; Angelo Salatino
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: In earlier work, we introduced a pipeline that, given a news corpus, i) uses a hybrid human-machine approach to identify the range of viewpoints expressed about a given topic, and ii) classifies relevant claims with respect to the identified viewpoints, defined as sets of semantically and ideologically congruent claims (e.g., positions arguing that immigration positively impacts the UK economy).

116, TITLE: SRE-FMaps: A Sinkhorn-Regularized Elastic Functional Map Framework for Non-Isometric 3D Shape Matching
AUTHORS: Dan Zhang; Yue Zhang; Ning Wang; Dong Zhao
CATEGORY: Journal of Imaging [JOURNAL OF IMAGING]

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Sinkhorn-Regularized Elastic Functional Map framework (SRE-FMaps) that integrates entropy-regularized optimal transport with an elastic thin-shell energy basis.

AUTHORS: Zhenhan Yin; Xuanhan Wang; Jiahao Jiang; Kaiyuan Deng; Pengqi Chen; Shuangle Li; Chong Liu; Xing Xu; ingkuan Song; Lianli Gao; Heng Tao Shen
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.RO [RO]
HIGHLIGHT: While leveraging abundant human videos and simulated robot data poses a scalable solution to the scarcity of real-world robot data, the generalization capability of existing vision-language-action models (VLAs) remains limited by mismatches in camera views, visual appearance, and embodiment morphologies. To overcome this limitation, we propose MiVLA, a generalizable VLA empowered by human-robot mutual imitation pre-training, which leverages inherent behavioral similarity between human hands and robotic arms to build a foundation of strong behavioral priors for both human actions and robotic control.
