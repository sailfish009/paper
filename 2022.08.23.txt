AUTHORS: Qihuang Zhong ; Liang Ding ; Juhua Liu ; Bo Du ; Dacheng Tao
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, such a vanilla PoT approach usually achieves sub-optimal performance, as (i) the PoT is sensitive to the similarity of source-target pair and (ii) directly fine-tuning the prompt initialized with source prompt on target task might lead to catastrophic forgetting of source knowledge. In response to these problems, we propose a new metric to accurately predict the prompt transferability (regarding (i)), and a novel PoT approach (namely PANDA) that leverages the knowledge distillation technique to transfer the "knowledge" from the source prompt to the target prompt in a subtle manner and alleviate the catastrophic forgetting effectively (regarding (ii)).

AUTHORS: Jianpeng Yang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to learn a classifier that can be easily adapted to recognize novel classes,given only a few labeled examples per class.Limited data keep this task challenging for deep learning.Recent metric-based methods has achieved promising performance based on image-level features.However,these global features ignore abundant local and structural information that is transferable and consistent between seen and unseen classes.Some study in cognitive science argue that humans can recognize novel classes with the learned primitives.We expect to mine both transferable and discriminative representation from base classes and adopt them to recognize novel classes.Building on the episodic training mechanism,We propose a Primitive Mining and Reasoning Network(PMRN) to learn primitive-aware representation in an end-to-end manner for metric-based FSL model.We first add self-supervision auxiliary task,forcing feature extractor to learn tvisual pattern corresponding to primitives.To further mine and produce transferable primitive-aware representations,we design an Adaptive Channel Grouping(ACG)module to synthesize a set of visual primitives from object embedding by enhancing informative channel maps while suppressing useless ones.

HIGHLIGHT: However, in the scope of this work, we show that the centered clipping framework has certain vulnerabilities, and existing attacks can be revised based on these vulnerabilities to circumvent the centered clipping defense. Hence, we introduce a strategy to design an attack to circumvent the centered clipping framework and numerically illustrate its effectiveness against centered clipping as well as other known defense strategies by reducing test accuracy to 5-40 on best-case scenarios.

AUTHORS: TINGTING WU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV]
