AUTHORS: Jundong Xu; Hao Fei; Huichi Zhou; Xin Quan; Qijun Huang; Shengqiong Wu; William Yang Wang; Mong-Li Lee; Wynne Hsu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Prior work introduces supervision on intermediate steps but still lacks guarantees of logical soundness, which is crucial in high-stakes scenarios where logical consistency is paramount. To address this, we propose LogicReward, a novel reward system that guides model training by enforcing step-level logical correctness with a theorem prover.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We find that even state-of-the-art models satisfy fewer than 72 percent of the goals and routinely miss localized edits, confirming the brittleness of current pipelines. To address this, we present VisionDirector, a training-free vision-language supervisor that (i) extracts structured goals from long instructions, (ii) dynamically decides between one-shot generation and staged edits, (iii) runs micro-grid sampling with semantic verification and rollback after every edit, and (iv) logs goal-level rewards.

16, TITLE: Visual-Aware CoT: Achieving High-Fidelity Visual Consistency in Unified Models
AUTHORS: Zixuan Ye; Quande Liu; Cong Wei; Yuanxing Zhang; Xintao Wang; Pengfei Wan; Kun Gai; Wenhan Luo
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To this end, we integrate the visual context consistency into the reasoning of unified models, explicitly motivating the model to sustain such consistency by 1) Adaptive Visual Planning: generating structured visual check list to figure out the visual element of needed consistency keeping, and 2) Iterative Visual Correction: performing self-reflection with the guidance of check lists and refining the generated result in an iterative manner. To achieve this, we use supervised finetuning to teach the model how to plan the visual checking, conduct self-reflection and self-refinement, and use flow-GRPO to further enhance the visual consistency through a customized visual checking reward.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Understanding what kinds of cooperative structures deep neural networks (DNNs) can represent remains a fundamental yet insufficiently understood problem. In this work, we treat interactions as the fundamental units of such structure and investigate a largely unexplored question: how DNNs encode interactions under different levels of contextual complexity, and how these microscopic interaction patterns shape macroscopic representation capacity.

19, TITLE: Stable and Efficient Single-Rollout RL for Multimodal Reasoning
AUTHORS: Rui Liu; Dian Yu; Lei Ke; Haolin Liu; Yujun Zhou; Zhenwen Liang; Haitao Mi; Pratap Tokekar; Dong Yu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While more efficient single-rollout variants have recently been explored in text-only settings, we find that they suffer from severe instability in multimodal contexts, often leading to training collapse. To address this training efficiency-stability trade-off, we introduce $\textbf{MSSR}$ (Multimodal Stabilized Single-Rollout), a group-free RLVR framework that achieves both stable optimization and effective multimodal reasoning performance.

AUTHORS: Tianrui Zhu; Shiyi Zhang; Zhirui Sun; Jingqi Tian; Yansong Tang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, current approaches in long video generation typically rely on window attention, which naively discards historical context outside the window, leading to catastrophic forgetting and scene inconsistency; conversely, retaining full history incurs prohibitive memory costs. To address this trade-off, we propose \textbf{Memorize-and-Generate (MAG)}, a framework that decouples memory compression and frame generation into distinct tasks.

AUTHORS: Guibin Zhang; Haotian Ren; Chong Zhan; Zhenhong Zhou; Junhao Wang; He Zhu; Wangchunshu Zhou; Shuicheng Yan
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, this paradigm is fundamentally constrained by the staticity of the memory system itself: while memory facilitates agent-level evolving, the underlying memory architecture cannot be meta-adapted to diverse task contexts. To address this gap, we propose MemEvolve, a meta-evolutionary framework that jointly evolves agents' experiential knowledge and their memory architecture, allowing agent systems not only to accumulate experience but also to progressively refine how they learn from it.

33, TITLE: LoGoPlanner: Localization Grounded Navigation Policy with Metric-aware Visual Geometry
AUTHORS: Jiaqi Peng; Wenzhe Cai; Yuqiang Yang; Tai Wang; Yuan Shen; Jiangmiao Pang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.RO [RO]
HIGHLIGHT: However, most prior end-to-end approaches still rely on separate localization modules that depend on accurate sensor extrinsic calibration for self-state estimation, thereby limiting generalization across embodiments and environments. We introduce LoGoPlanner, a localization-grounded, end-to-end navigation framework that addresses these limitations by: (1) finetuning a long-horizon visual-geometry backbone to ground predictions with absolute metric scale, thereby providing implicit state estimation for accurate localization; (2) reconstructing surrounding scene geometry from historical observations to supply dense, fine-grained environmental awareness for reliable obstacle avoidance; and (3) conditioning the policy on implicit geometry bootstrapped by the aforementioned auxiliary tasks, thereby reducing error propagation.We evaluate LoGoPlanner in both simulation and real-world settings, where its fully end-to-end design reduces cumulative error while metric-aware geometry memory enhances planning consistency and obstacle avoidance, leading to more than a 27.3\% improvement over oracle-localization baselines and strong generalization across embodiments and environments.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Crucially, our analysis of downstream planning tasks reveals a severe asymmetry: while rearward perception errors are often tolerable, inaccuracies in the forward region directly precipitate hazardous driving maneuvers. To bridge this safety gap, we propose AMap, a novel framework for Ahead-aware online HD Mapping.

41, TITLE: EchoMotion: Unified Human Video and Motion Generation Via Dual-Modality Diffusion Transformer
AUTHORS: Yuxiao Yang; Hualian Sheng; Sijia Cai; Jing Lin; Jiahao Wang; Bing Deng; Junzhe Lu; Haoqian Wang; Jieping Ye
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This limitation stems from the intrinsic constraints of pixel-only training objectives, which inherently bias models toward appearance fidelity at the expense of learning underlying kinematic principles. To address this, we introduce EchoMotion, a framework designed to model the joint distribution of appearance and human motion, thereby improving the quality of complex human action video generation.

42, TITLE: Auditing Significance, Metric Choice, and Demographic Fairness in Medical AI Challenges
AUTHORS: Ariel Lubonja; Pedro R. A. S. Bassi; Wenxuan Li; Hualin Qiao; Randal Burns; Alan L. Yuille; Zongwei Zhou
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite their importance, medical AI leaderboards exhibit three persistent limitations: (1) score gaps are rarely tested for statistical significance, so rank stability is unknown; (2) single averaged metrics are applied to every organ, hiding clinically important boundary errors; (3) performance across intersecting demographics is seldom reported, masking fairness and equity gaps. We introduce RankInsight, an open-source toolkit that seeks to address these limitations.

AUTHORS: Ziyang Song; Zelin Zang; Zuyao Chen; Xusheng Liang; Dong Yi; Jinlin Wu; Hongbin Liu; Jiebo Luo
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While recent work has demonstrated that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can enhance reasoning in MLLMs without relying on large amounts of data, we find two weaknesses that hinder GRPO's reasoning performance in anatomy recognition: 1) knowledge cannot be effectively shared between different anatomical structures, resulting in uneven information gain and preventing the model from converging, and 2) the model quickly converges to a single reasoning path, suppressing the exploration of diverse strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose two novel methods.

AUTHORS: Maxime Méloux; Giada Dirupo; François Portet; Maxime Peyrard
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In AI interpretability, reports of similar ''dead salmon'' artifacts abound: feature attribution, probing, sparse auto-encoding, and even causal analyses can produce plausible-looking explanations for randomly initialized neural networks. In this work, we examine this phenomenon and argue for a pragmatic statistical-causal reframing: explanations of computational systems should be treated as parameters of a (statistical) model, inferred from computational traces.

277, TITLE: When in Doubt, Deliberate: Confidence-Based Routing to Expert Debate for Sexism Detection
AUTHORS: Anwar Alajmi; Gabriele Pergola
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]

279, TITLE: Distinguishing Visually Similar Actions: Prompt-Guided Semantic Prototype Modulation for Few-Shot Action Recognition
AUTHORS: Xiaoyang Li; Mingming Lu; Ruiqi Wang; Hao Li; Zewei Le
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Current research primarily addresses three core challenges: (1) temporal modeling, where models are prone to interference from irrelevant static background information and struggle to capture the essence of dynamic action features; (2) visual similarity, where categories with subtle visual differences are difficult to distinguish; and (3) the modality gap between visual-textual support prototypes and visual-only queries, which complicates alignment within a shared embedding space. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a CLIP-SPM framework, which includes three components: (1) the Hierarchical Synergistic Motion Refinement (HSMR) module, which aligns deep and shallow motion features to improve temporal modeling by reducing static background interference; (2) the Semantic Prototype Modulation (SPM) strategy, which generates query-relevant text prompts to bridge the modality gap and integrates them with visual features, enhancing the discriminability between similar actions; and (3) the Prototype-Anchor Dual Modulation (PADM) method, which refines support prototypes and aligns query features with a global semantic anchor, improving consistency across support and query samples.

AUTHORS: Janghyun Baek; Mincheol Chang; Seokha Moon; Seung Joon Lee; Jinkyu Kim
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent query-based 3D object detection methods using camera and LiDAR inputs have shown strong performance, but existing query initialization strategies,such as random sampling or BEV heatmap-based sampling, often result in inefficient query usage and reduced accuracy, particularly for occluded or crowded objects. To address this limitation, we propose ALIGN (Advanced query initialization with LiDAR and Image GuidaNce), a novel approach for occlusion-robust, object-aware query initialization.

285, TITLE: Towards Closed-Loop Embodied Empathy Evolution: Probing LLM-Centric Lifelong Empathic Motion Generation in Unseen Scenarios
AUTHORS: Jiawen Wang; Jingjing Wang Tianyang Chen; Min Zhang; Guodong Zhou
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In the literature, existing human-centric emotional motion generation methods primarily focus on boosting performance within a single scale-fixed dataset, largely neglecting the flexible and scale-increasing motion scenarios (e.g., sports, dance), whereas effectively learning these newly emerging scenarios can significantly enhance the model's real-world generalization ability. Inspired by this, this paper proposes a new LLM-Centric Lifelong Empathic Motion Generation (L^2-EMG) task, which aims to equip LLMs with the capability to continually acquire emotional motion generation knowledge across different unseen scenarios, potentially contributing to building a closed-loop and self-evolving embodied agent equipped with both empathy and intelligence.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at video understanding tasks, their real-time mobile deployment is constrained by heavy computational costs and inefficient redundant frame processing. To address these issues, we propose the FC-MIR framework: leveraging keyframe sampling and adaptive concatenation, it cuts visual redundancy to boost inference efficiency, while integrating state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs or fine-tuned models (e.g., Qwen3-VL) for trajectory summarization and intent prediction.

494, TITLE: Attention Is Not What You Need
AUTHORS: Zhang Chong
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We argue that standard multi-head attention is best seen as a form of tensor lifting: hidden vectors are mapped into a high-dimensional space of pairwise interactions, and learning proceeds by constraining this lifted tensor through gradient descent. This mechanism is extremely expressive but mathematically opaque, because after many layers it becomes very hard to describe the model with a small family of explicit invariants.
