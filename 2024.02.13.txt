We prove that the addition of a random mask to an imaging system removes its dependence on aberrations, reducing the likelihood of zeros in the transfer function and consequently reducing the sensitivity to noise during deconvolution.

In this work, we study this phenomenon in the simplified setting of kernel regression and obtain results which show a clear crossover between where the model can cope with fake data, and a regime where the model's performance completely collapses.
