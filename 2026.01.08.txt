AUTHORS: Haonan Chen ; Sicheng Gao ; Radu Timofte ; Tetsuya Sakai ; Zhicheng Dou
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models.  [Save to Library]
