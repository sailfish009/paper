AUTHORS: Zijian Zhao ; Sen Li
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.ET, cs.MA]
HIGHLIGHT: However, conventional MARL-based ride-sharingapproaches heavily rely on the accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values,which becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments.Specifically, most of these approaches adopt an independent paradigm,exacerbating this issue, as each agent treats others as part of theenvironment, leading to unstable training and substantial estimation bias invalue functions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel alternativemethods that bypass value function estimation.

388, TITLE: Pruning Increases Orderedness in Recurrent Computation
AUTHORS: Yiding Song
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Taking directionality as topologically-orderedinformation flow between neurons, we formalise a perceptron layer withall-to-all connections (mathematically equivalent to a weight-tied recurrentneural network) and demonstrate that directionality, a hallmark of modernfeed-forward networks, can be induced rather than hard-wired by applyingappropriate pruning techniques.

389, TITLE: Flow Equivariant Recurrent Neural Networks
AUTHORS: T. Anderson Keller
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To date, however, equivariance has been considered only for statictransformations and feed-forward networks, limiting its applicability tosequence models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and correspondingtime-parameterized sequence transformations. In this work, we extendequivariant network theory to this regime of `flows' -- one-parameter Liesubgroups capturing natural transformations over time, such as visual motion.We begin by showing that standard RNNs are generally not flow equivariant:their hidden states fail to transform in a geometrically structured manner formoving stimuli.

AUTHORS: Shrunal Pothagoni ; Benjamin Schweinhart
