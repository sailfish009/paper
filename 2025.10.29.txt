To fill this gap, we propose a novel quadratic-form weightedtraining objective, addressing both of the issues simultaneously.

HIGHLIGHT: Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- whereanswers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead requiremulti-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incursprohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneckfor training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents. To address this, we present an automated framework for generatinghigh-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structuredknowledge sources.
