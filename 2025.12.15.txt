311, TITLE: Reframing Music-Driven 2D Dance Pose Generation As Multi-Channel Image Generation
AUTHORS: Yan Zhang; Han Zou; Lincong Feng; Cong Xie; Ruiqi Yu; Zhenpeng Zhan
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We address this by reframing music-to-dance generation as a music-token-conditioned multi-channel image synthesis problem: 2D pose sequences are encoded as one-hot images, compressed by a pretrained image VAE, and modeled with a DiT-style backbone, allowing us to inherit architectural and training advances from modern text-to-image models and better capture high-variance 2D pose distributions. On top of this formulation, we introduce (i) a time-shared temporal indexing scheme that explicitly synchronizes music tokens and pose latents over time and (ii) a reference-pose conditioning strategy that preserves subject-specific body proportions and on-screen scale while enabling long-horizon segment-and-stitch generation.

AUTHORS: Junhong Ren; Sen Chen; Yange Sun; Huaping Guo; Yongqiang Tang; Wensheng Zhang
CATEGORY: Electronics [ELECTRONICS]
HIGHLIGHT: Deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Mamba have advanced medical image segmentation, yet two challenges remain: (1) trade-off in feature extraction, where CNNs capture local details but miss global context, and Mamba captures global dependencies but overlooks fine structures, and (2) limited feature aggregation, as existing methods insufficiently integrate inter-layer common information and delta details, hindering robustness to subtle structures.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.HC [HC]
HIGHLIGHT: By analyzing a representative production system, we move beyond simple latency metrics to identify three recurring patterns of conversational breakdown: (1) Temporal Misalignment, where system delays violate user expectations of conversational rhythm; (2) Expressive Flattening, where the loss of paralinguistic cues leads to literal, inappropriate responses; and (3) Repair Rigidity, where architectural gating prevents users from correcting errors in real-time. Through system-level analysis, we demonstrate that these friction points should not be understood as defects or failures, but as structural consequences of a modular design that prioritizes control over fluidity.
