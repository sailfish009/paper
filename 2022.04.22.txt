108, TITLE: On Distribution Shift in Learning-based Bug Detectors
AUTHORS: Jingxuan He ; Luca Beurer-Kellner ; Martin Vechev
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.PL, cs.SE]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite achieving high test accuracy (e.g. >90%), the resulting bug detectors are found to be surprisingly unusable in practice, i.e., <10% precision when used to scan real software repositories. In this work, we argue that this massive performance difference is caused by distribution shift, i.e., a fundamental mismatch between the real bug distribution and the synthetic bug distribution used to train and evaluate the detectors.
