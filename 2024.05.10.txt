AUTHORS: Yudian Zhang ; Chenhao Xu ; Kaiye Xu ; Haijiang Zhu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In polyp segmentation of medical images, we find most diseased area occupies only a small portion of the entire image, resulting in previous models being not well-calibrated for lesion regions but well-calibrated for background, despite their seemingly better Expected Calibration Error (ECE) scores overall. Therefore, we proposed four-branches calibration network with Mask-Loss and Mask-TS strategies to more focus on the scaling of logits within potential lesion regions, which serves to mitigate the influence of background interference.
