151, TITLE: Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM for Industrial Anomaly Detection
AUTHORS: Cory Gardner ; Byungseok Min ; Tae-Hyuk Ahn
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We proposeWavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiMapplies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specificfrequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenatesthem channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for featureselection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveragingmulti-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection.

177, TITLE: Towards Diagnostic Quality Flat-Panel Detector CT Imaging Using Diffusion Models
AUTHORS: H�L�NE CORBAZ et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The imagequality of the flat panel detector CT (FDCT) present in the intervention roomis generally much lower than that of a MDCT due to significant artifacts.However, using only FDCT images could improve patient management as the patientwould not need to be moved to the MDCT room. Several studies have evaluated thepotential use of FDCT imaging alone and the time that could be saved byacquiring the images before and/or after the intervention only with the FDCT.This study proposes using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) toimprove the image quality of FDCT scans, making them comparable to MDCT scans.Clinicans evaluated FDCT, MDCT, and our model's predictions for diagnosticpurposes using a questionnaire.
