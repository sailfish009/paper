HIGHLIGHT: We propose a regularization scheme for image reconstruction that leverages the power of deep learning while hinging on classic sparsity-promoting models.

244, TITLE: MRI Volume-Based Robust Brain Age Estimation Using Weight-Shared Spatial Attention in 3D CNNs
AUTHORS: Vamshi Krishna Kancharla ; Neelam Sinha
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a robust brain age estimation paradigm that utilizes a 3D CNN model, by-passing the need for model-retraining across datasets.
