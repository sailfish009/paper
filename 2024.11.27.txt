164, TITLE: MALMM: Multi-Agent Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Robotics Manipulation
AUTHORS: Harsh Singh ; Rocktim Jyoti Das ; Mingfei Han ; Preslav Nakov ; Ivan Laptev

HIGHLIGHT: While recent efforts in robotics have leveraged LLMs both for high-level and low-level planning, these approaches often face significant challenges, such as hallucinations in long-horizon tasks and limited adaptability due to the generation of plans in a single pass without real-time feedback. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-agent LLM framework, Multi-Agent Large Language Model for Manipulation (MALMM) that distributes high-level planning and low-level control code generation across specialized LLM agents, supervised by an additional agent that dynamically manages transitions.

165, TITLE: Structure-Guided MR-to-CT Synthesis with Spatial and Semantic Alignments for Attenuation Correction of Whole-Body PET/MR Imaging
AUTHORS: Jiaxu Zheng ; Zhenrong Shen ; Lichi Zhang ; Qun Chen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, whole-body MR-to-CT synthesis faces several challenges including the issue of spatial misalignment and the complexity of intensity mapping, primarily due to the variety of tissues and organs throughout the whole body. Here we propose a novel whole-body MR-to-CT synthesis framework, which consists of three novel modules to tackle these challenges: (1) Structure-Guided Synthesis module leverages structure-guided attention gates to enhance synthetic image quality by diminishing unnecessary contours of soft tissues; (2) Spatial Alignment module yields precise registration between paired MR and CT images by taking into account the impacts of tissue volumes and respiratory movements, thus providing well-aligned ground-truth CT images during training; (3) Semantic Alignment module utilizes contrastive learning to constrain organ-related semantic information, thereby ensuring the semantic authenticity of synthetic CT images.We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed whole-body MR-to-CT framework can produce visually plausible and semantically realistic CT images, and validate its utility in PET attenuation correction.
