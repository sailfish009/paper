Building on this insight, we propose a novel UGRL method based on Multi-hop feature Quality Estimation (MQE for short).

This paper presents a culmination of work on this concept in the form of a computational framework called Factorized Machine Self-confidence (FaMSeC), which provides an engineering-focused holistic description of factors driving an algorithmic decision-making process, including outcome assessment, solver quality, model quality, alignment quality, and past experience.

316, TITLE: Query Maintenance Under Batch Changes with Small-depth Circuits
AUTHORS: SAMIR DATTA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.CC]
HIGHLIGHT: We show that most of the existing results for constant-size changes can be recovered for batch changes of polylogarithmic size if one allows circuits of depth O(log log n) or, equivalently, first-order updates that are iterated O(log log n) times.

317, TITLE: AxiomVision: Accuracy-Guaranteed Adaptive Visual Model Selection for Perspective-Aware Video Analytics
AUTHORS: XIANGXIANG DAI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.MM [cs.MM, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This work introduces AxiomVision, a novel framework that can guarantee accuracy by leveraging edge computing to dynamically select the most efficient visual models for video analytics under diverse scenarios.

318, TITLE: Crafting Generative Art Through Genetic Improvement: Managing Creative Outputs in Diverse Fitness Landscapes
AUTHORS: Erik M. Fredericks ; Denton Bobeldyk ; Jared M. Moore
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Furthermore, we have added an additional fitness function that uses a classifier for mimicking a human's assessment as to whether an output is considered as "art." This classifier is trained on a dataset of input images resembling the glitch art aesthetic that we aim to create.

319, TITLE: Modeling Local Search Metaheuristics Using Markov Decision Processes
AUTHORS: Rub�n Ruiz-Torrubiano
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, 68T20, I.2.8]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework based on Markov Decision Processes (MDP) for analyzing local search metaheuristics.

320, TITLE: Theia: Distilling Diverse Vision Foundation Models for Robot Learning
AUTHORS: JINGHUAN SHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Vision-based robot policy learning, which maps visual inputs to actions, necessitates a holistic understanding of diverse visual tasks beyond single-task needs like classification or segmentation. Inspired by this, we introduce Theia, a vision foundation model for robot learning that distills multiple off-the-shelf vision foundation models trained on varied vision tasks.

321, TITLE: Genetic Algorithm-based Routing and Scheduling for Wildfire Suppression Using A Team of UAVs
AUTHORS: Josy John ; Suresh Sundaram
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.MA, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper addresses early wildfire management using a team of UAVs for the mitigation of fires.

AUTHORS: TUAN VAN VO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Incorporating natural language into grasp detection remains a challenging task and largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a new method for language-driven grasp detection with mask-guided attention by utilizing the transformer attention mechanism with semantic segmentation features.

AUTHORS: Jingyue Huang ; Yi-Hsuan Yang
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel functional representation for symbolic music.

325, TITLE: Recent Developments in Real Quantifier Elimination and Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition
AUTHORS: Matthew England
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC, 68W30, I.1.2]
HIGHLIGHT: After introducing these concepts we will first consider adaptations of CAD inspired by computational logic, in particular the algorithms which underpin modern SAT solvers. CAD theory has found use in collaboration with these via the Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) paradigm; while the ideas behind SAT/SMT have led to new algorithms for Real QE.
