AUTHORS: Zilu Dong ; Xiangqing Shen ; Rui Xia
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Our analysis reveals that the root cause lies in MEMIT's key value modeling framework: When multiple facts with the same subject in a batch are modeled through MEMIT's key value mechanism, identical keys (derived from the shared subject) are forced to represent different values (corresponding to different knowledge), resulting in updates conflicts during editing. Addressing this issue, we propose MEMIT-Merge, an enhanced approach that merges value computation processes for facts sharing the same subject, effectively resolving the performance degradation in same-subject batch editing scenarios.

158, TITLE: Dense Object Detection Based on De-homogenized Queries
AUTHORS: Yueming Huang ; Chenrui Ma ; Hao Zhou ; Hao Wu ; Guowu Yuan
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Through the end-to-end DETR (DEtection TRansformer), as a type of detector that can incorporate the post-processing de-duplication capability of NMS, etc., into the network, we found that homogeneous queries in the query-based detector lead to a reduction in the de-duplication capability of the network and the learning efficiency of the encoder, resulting in duplicate prediction and missed detection problems. To solve this problem, we propose learnable differentiated encoding to de-homogenize the queries, and at the same time, queries can communicate with each other via differentiated encoding information, replacing the previous self-attention among the queries.

HIGHLIGHT: Thus, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based approach that jointly optimizes the UAV movement, user transmit power, and user association in real time to solve the problem efficiently.

239, TITLE: Verifying LLM-Generated Code in The Context of Software Verification with Ada/SPARK
AUTHORS: Marcos Cramer ; Lucian McIntyre

HIGHLIGHT: We present Marmaragan, a tool that leverages an LLM in order to generate SPARK annotations for existing programs, enabling formal verification of the code.

240, TITLE: SnipGen: A Mining Repository Framework for Evaluating LLMs for Code
AUTHORS: Daniel Rodriguez-Cardenas ; Alejandro Velasco ; Denys Poshyvany
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, evaluating their effectiveness poses significant challenges, primarily due to the potential overlap between the datasets used for training and those employed for evaluation. To address this issue, we introduce SnipGen, a comprehensive repository mining framework designed to leverage prompt engineering across various downstream tasks for code generation.

241, TITLE: WebChecker: A Versatile EVL Plugin for Validating HTML Pages with Bootstrap Frameworks
AUTHORS: Milind Cherukuri

HIGHLIGHT: To substantiate our claims, I present an illustrative example featuring two solutions that effectively enforce implicit rules.

242, TITLE: LoRP-TTS: Low-Rank Personalized Text-To-Speech
AUTHORS: ?ukasz Bondaruk ; Jakub Kubiak
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we demonstrate that utilizing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) allows us to successfully use even single recordings of spontaneous speech in noisy environments as prompts.

243, TITLE: Supervised Contrastive Learning for Cell Stage Classification of Animal Embryos
AUTHORS: YASMINE HACHANI et. al.
CATEGORY: q-bio.QM [q-bio.QM, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The challenges are three-fold: (1) low-quality images and bovine dark cells that make the identification of cell stages difficult, (2) class ambiguity at the boundaries of developmental stages, and (3) imbalanced data distribution. To address these challenges, we introduce CLEmbryo, a novel method that leverages supervised contrastive learning combined with focal loss for training, and the lightweight 3D neural network CSN-50 as an encoder.

244, TITLE: Quantitative Evaluation of Unsupervised Clustering Algorithms for Dynamic Total-body PET Image Analysis
AUTHORS: Oona Rainio ; Maria K. Jaakkola ; Riku Kl�n
CATEGORY: stat.AP [stat.AP, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we compare the performance of 15 unsupervised clustering methods, including K-means either by itself or after principal component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), fuzzy c-means (FCM), agglomerative clustering, spectral clustering, and several newer clustering algorithms, for classifying time activity curves (TACs) in dynamic PET images.

245, TITLE: A Framework for Supervised and Unsupervised Segmentation and Classification of Materials Microstructure Images
AUTHORS: Kungang Zhang ; Daniel W. Apley ; Wei Chen ; Wing K. Liu ; L. Catherine Brinson
CATEGORY: stat.AP [stat.AP, cs.CV, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: Microstructure of materials is often characterized through image analysis to understand processing-structure-properties linkages. We propose a largely automated framework that integrates unsupervised and supervised learning methods to classify micrographs according to microstructure phase/class and, for multiphase microstructures, segments them into different homogeneous regions.

246, TITLE: Generalizable Automated Ischaemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation with Vision Transformers
AUTHORS: CHRIS FOULON et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Current U-Net-based models therefore underperform, a problem accentuated by inadequate evaluation metrics that focus on mean performance, neglecting anatomical, subpopulation, and acquisition-dependent variability. Here, we present a high-performance DWI lesion segmentation tool addressing these challenges through optimized vision transformer-based architectures, integration of 3563 annotated lesions from multi-site data, and algorithmic enhancements, achieving state-of-the-art results.
