HIGHLIGHT: Empirically, in the late phases of training, the AT becomes more overfitting to the extent that the individuals for weight averaging also suffer from overfitting and produce anomalous weight values, which causes the self-ensemble model to continue to undergo robust overfitting due to the failure in removing the weight anomalies. To solve this problem, we aim to tackle the influence of outliers in the weight space in this work and propose an easy-to-operate and effective Median-Ensemble Adversarial Training (MEAT) method to solve the robust overfitting phenomenon existing in self-ensemble defense from the source by searching for the median of the historical model weights.
