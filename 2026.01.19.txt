AUTHORS: Zhongxiang Sun; Yi Zhan; Chenglei Shen; Weijie Yu; Xiao Zhang; Ming He; Jun Xu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We show that when personalized LLMs face factual queries, there exists a phenomenon where the model generates answers aligned with a user's prior history rather than the objective truth, resulting in personalization-induced hallucinations that degrade factual reliability and may propagate incorrect beliefs, due to representational entanglement between personalization and factual representations. To address this issue, we propose Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering (FPPS), a lightweight inference-time approach that mitigates personalization-induced factual distortions while preserving personalized behavior.

84, TITLE: Wetland Mapping from Sparse Annotations with Satellite Image Time Series and Temporal-aware Segment Anything Model
AUTHORS: Shuai Yuan; Tianwu Lin; Shuang Chen; Yu Xia; Peng Qin; Xiangyu Liu; Xiaoqing Xu; Nan Xu; Hongsheng Zhang; Jie Wang; Peng Gong
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Accurate wetland mapping is essential for ecosystem monitoring, yet dense pixel-level annotation is prohibitively expensive and practical applications usually rely on sparse point labels, under which existing deep learning models perform poorly, while strong seasonal and inter-annual wetland dynamics further render single-date imagery inadequate and lead to significant mapping errors; although foundation models such as SAM show promising generalization from point prompts, they are inherently designed for static images and fail to model temporal information, resulting in fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetlands. To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches.

To address these issues, we introduce Reasoning Tree Guided RAG (RT-RAG), a novel hierarchical framework for complex multi-hop QA.

117, TITLE: Scalable Information Theoretic Evaluation of The Rank Statistics in Side-Channel Attacks
AUTHORS: Julien Béguinot; Olivier Rioul; Loïc Masure; François-Xavier Standaert; Wei Cheng; Sylvain Guilley
CATEGORY: IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded ... [IACR TRANSACTIONS ON CRYPTOGRAPHIC HARDWARE AND EMBEDDED ...]
HIGHLIGHT: One prominent strategy for this purpose is to characterize the distribution of the rank of the correct key among the different key hypotheses produced by a maximum likelihood attack, depending on the number of measured traces. In practice, evaluators can estimate some statistics of the rank that are used as security indicators—e.g., the arithmetic and geometric mean rank, the median rank, the α-marginal guesswork, or the success rate of level L. Yet, a direct estimation becomes time-consuming as security levels increase.In this work, we provide new bounds on these figures of merit in terms of the mutual information between the secret and its side-channel leakages.

AUTHORS: Aiman Al Masoud; Marco Arazzi; Antonino Nocera
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CR [CR]
HIGHLIGHT: Only a few approaches propose techniques to instruct the generative model to refrain from disclosing sensitive information; however, recent studies have also demonstrated that LLMs remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can override intended behavioral constraints. For these reasons, we propose a novel approach to Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation, called SD-RAG, which decouples the enforcement of security and privacy constraints from the generation process itself.

AUTHORS: Lecheng Yan; Ruizhe Li; Guanhua Chen; Qing Li; Jiahui Geng; Wenxi Li; Vincent Wang; Chris Lee
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is highly effective for enhancing LLM reasoning, yet recent evidence shows models like Qwen 2.5 achieve significant gains even with spurious or incorrect rewards. We investigate this phenomenon and identify a "Perplexity Paradox": spurious RLVR triggers a divergence where answer-token perplexity drops while prompt-side coherence degrades, suggesting the model is bypassing reasoning in favor of memorization.

AUTHORS: Zhikang Shen; Jianrong Lu; Haiyuan Wan; Jianhai Chen
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]

To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations.

373, TITLE: Large Language Models As Simulative Agents for Neurodivergent Adult Psychometric Profiles
AUTHORS: Francesco Chiappone; Davide Marocco; Nicola Milano
CATEGORY: arxiv-q-bio.NC [NC]
HIGHLIGHT: While recent work suggests that Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate human psychometric responses from qualitative data, it remains unclear whether they can accurately and stably model neurodevelopmental traits rather than broad personality characteristics. This study examines whether LLMs can generate psychometric responses that approximate those of real individuals when grounded in a structured qualitative interview, and whether such simulations are sensitive to variations in trait intensity.
