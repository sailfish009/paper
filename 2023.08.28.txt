127, TITLE: Decoupled Structure for Improved Adaptability of End-to-End Models
AUTHORS: Keqi Deng ; Philip C. Woodland
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: Although end-to-end (E2E) trainable automatic speech recognition (ASR) has shown great success by jointly learning acoustic and linguistic information, it still suffers from the effect of domain shifts, thus limiting potential applications. The E2E ASR model implicitly learns an internal language model (LM) which characterises the training distribution of the source domain, and the E2E trainable nature makes the internal LM difficult to adapt to the target domain with text-only data To solve this problem, this paper proposes decoupled structures for attention-based encoder-decoder (Decoupled-AED) and neural transducer (Decoupled-Transducer) models, which can achieve flexible domain adaptation in both offline and online scenarios while maintaining robust intra-domain performance.
