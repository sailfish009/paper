AUTHORS: Hang Guo; Zhaoyang Jia; Jiahao Li; Bin Li; Yuanhao Cai; Jiangshan Wang; Yawei Li; Yan Lu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we identify that the multi-head self-attention in these models under-utilizes historical frames: approximately 25% heads attend almost exclusively to the current frame, and discarding their KV caches incurs only minor performance degradation. Building upon this, we propose Dummy Forcing, a simple yet effective method to control context accessibility across different heads.

AUTHORS: Hongyu Zhou; Zisen Shao; Sheng Miao; Pan Wang; Dongfeng Bai; Bingbing Liu; Yiyi Liao
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent approaches leverage generative models, such as diffusion models, to provide additional supervision, but face a trade-off between generalization and fidelity: fine-tuning diffusion models for artifact removal improves fidelity but risks overfitting, while fine-tuning-free methods preserve generalization but often yield lower fidelity. We introduce FreeFix, a fine-tuning-free approach that pushes the boundary of this trade-off by enhancing extrapolated rendering with pretrained image diffusion models.

65, TITLE: RAW-Flow: Advancing RGB-to-RAW Image Reconstruction with Deterministic Latent Flow Matching
AUTHORS: Zhen Liu; Diedong Feng; Hai Jiang; Liaoyuan Zeng; Hao Wang; Chaoyu Feng; Lei Lei; Bing Zeng; Shuaicheng Liu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite notable progress, existing learning-based methods typically treat this task as a direct regression objective and struggle with detail inconsistency and color deviation, due to the ill-posed nature of inverse ISP and the inherent information loss in quantized RGB images. To address these limitations, we pioneer a generative perspective by reformulating RGB-to-RAW reconstruction as a deterministic latent transport problem and introduce a novel framework named RAW-Flow, which leverages flow matching to learn a deterministic vector field in latent space, to effectively bridge the gap between RGB and RAW representations and enable accurate reconstruction of structural details and color information.

AUTHORS: Dasarath Neupane
CATEGORY: NPRC Journal of Multidisciplinary Research [NPRC JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH]
HIGHLIGHT: Objectives: The review article is guided by three objectives: first, to explain the key philosophical concepts of the Bhagavad Gita-namely, dharma, karma, nishkama karma, atman, and gunas-in an easy-to-understand manner; second, to demarcate the current landscape of AI in businesses, focusing on its functional use in practice and the ongoing ethical issues it poses, including bias, accountability, and the future of work; and third, to build a useful, cross-disciplinary bridge by applying the conceptual framework of the Gita to diagnose and find solutions for these contemporary business problems. Methods: Focusing on the narrative review approach, this article intends to bring together primary sources on Hindu philosophy itself—in the form of translations and commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita—and present the findings in terms of business and technology literature using the comparative approach to these issues.

AUTHORS: Guoan Wang; Feiyu Wang; Zongwei Lv; Yikun Zong; Tong Yang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, most quantization-aware training (QAT) methods apply hard rounding and the straight-through estimator (STE) from the beginning of the training, which prematurely discretizes the optimization landscape and induces persistent gradient mismatch between latent weights and quantized weights, hindering effective optimization of quantized models. To address this, we propose Hestia, a Hessian-guided differentiable QAT framework for extremely low-bit LLMs, which replaces the rigid step function with a temperature-controlled softmax relaxation to maintain gradient flow early in training while progressively hardening quantization.

447, TITLE: Context Tokens Are Anchors: Understanding The Repetition Curse in DMLLMs from An Information Flow Perspective
AUTHORS: Qiyan Zhao; Xiaofeng Zhang; Shuochen Chang; Qianyu Chen; Xiaosong Yuan; Xuhang Chen; Luoqi Liu; Jiajun Zhang; Xu-Yao Zhang; Da-Han Wang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Our work reveals three key findings: (1) context tokens aggregate semantic information as anchors and guide the final predictions; (2) as information propagates across layers, the entropy of context tokens converges in deeper layers, reflecting the model's growing prediction certainty; (3) Repetition is typically linked to disruptions in the information flow of context tokens and to the inability of their entropy to converge in deeper layers. Based on these insights, we present \textbf{CoTA}, a plug-and-play method for mitigating repetition.
