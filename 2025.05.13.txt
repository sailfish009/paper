75, TITLE: Discovering Fine-Grained Visual-Concept Relations By Disentangled Optimal Transport Concept Bottleneck Models
AUTHORS: YAN XIE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing CBMs just learn coarse-grained relations between the whole image and the concepts, less considering local image information, leading to two main drawbacks: i) they often produce spurious visual-concept relations, hence decreasing model reliability; and ii) though CBMs could explain the importance of every concept to the final prediction, it is still challenging to tell which visual region produces the prediction. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a Disentangled Optimal Transport CBM (DOT-CBM) framework to explore fine-grained visual-concept relations between local image patches and concepts.

AUTHORS: Sumyyah Toonsi ; Paul Schofield ; Robert Hoehndorf
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, q-bio.BM]

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel formulation of Causal Knowledge Graphs (CKGs) which extend knowledge graphs with formal causal semantics, preserving their deductive capabilities while enabling principled causal inference.
