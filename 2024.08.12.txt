79, TITLE: GuidedNet: Semi-Supervised Multi-Organ Segmentation Via Labeled Data Guide Unlabeled Data
AUTHORS: HAOCHEN ZHAO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the two training flows are separate, which does not reflect the interrelationship between labeled and unlabeled data.To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised multi-organ segmentation method called GuidedNet, which leverages the knowledge from labeled data to guide the training of unlabeled data. The primary goals of this study are to improve the quality of pseudo-labels for unlabeled data and to enhance the network's learning capability for both small and complex organs.A key concept is that voxel features from labeled and unlabeled data that are close to each other in the feature space are more likely to belong to the same class.On this basis, a 3D Consistent Gaussian Mixture Model (3D-CGMM) is designed to leverage the feature distributions from labeled data to rectify the generated pseudo-labels.

We present a study that documents and quantifies this problem in three datasets on our simulation environment that implements network asynchrony, and we show that models trained with layer synchronization either perform sub-optimally in absence of the synchronization, or they will fail to benefit from any energy and latency reduction, when such a mechanism is in place.
