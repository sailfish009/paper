	We provide a meta-interpreter that conservatively extends Prolog with 
delimited control and show that it enables a range of typical Prolog 
features and extensions, now at the library level: findall, cut, 
branch-and-bound optimisation, probabilistic programming,...

81, TITLE:	Certified Compilation of Financial Contracts
AUTHORS:	Danil Annenkov ; Martin Elsman
CATEGORY:	cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT:
	We present an extension to a certified financial contract management 
system that allows for templated declarative financial contracts and for
 integration with financial stochastic models through verified 
compilation into so-called payoff-expressions.

82, TITLE:	Extracting Functional Programs from Coq, in Coq
AUTHORS:	Danil Annenkov ; Mikkel Milo ; Jakob Botsch Nielsen ; Bas Spitters
CATEGORY:	cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.LO]
HIGHLIGHT:	We implement extraction of Coq programs to functional languages based on MetaCoq's certified erasure.

83, TITLE:	Transformation-Enabled Precondition Inference
AUTHORS:	Bishoksan Kafle ; Graeme Gange ; Peter J. Stuckey ; Peter Schachte ; Harald Sondergaard
CATEGORY:	cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT:	We present a novel iterative method for automatically deriving preconditions for the safety and unsafety of programs.

84, TITLE:	Attainment Regions in Feature-Parameter Space for High-Level Debugging in Autonomous Robots
AUTHORS:	Simón C. Smith ; Subramanian Ramamoorthy
CATEGORY:	cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:
	To overcome this problem, we propose a performance function whose 
domain is defined by external features and parameters of the controller.

85, TITLE:	Dynamic Semantic Occupancy Mapping Using 3D Scene Flow and Closed-Form Bayesian Inference
AUTHORS:	AISHWARYA UNNIKRISHNAN et. al.
CATEGORY:	cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	This paper reports on a dynamic semantic mapping framework that 
incorporates 3D scene flow measurements into a closed-form Bayesian 
inference model.

86, TITLE:	An Empirical Study on End-to-End Singing Voice Synthesis with Encoder-Decoder Architectures
AUTHORS:	DENGFENG KE et. al.
CATEGORY:	cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this work, in order to explore how to improve the quality and 
efficiency of singing voice synthesis, in this work, we use 
encoder-decoder neural models and a number of vocoders to achieve 
singing voice synthesis.

87, TITLE:	Supervised Neural Networks for Illiquid Alternative Asset Cash Flow Forecasting
AUTHORS:	Tugce Karatas ; Federico Klinkert ; Ali Hirsa
CATEGORY:	q-fin.GN [q-fin.GN, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper, we develop a benchmark model and present two novel 
approaches (direct vs. indirect) to predict the cash flows of private 
equity funds.

88, TITLE:	Ada-VSR: Adaptive Video Super-Resolution with Meta-Learning
AUTHORS:	Akash Gupta ; Padmaja Jonnalagedda ; Bir Bhanu ; Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:	In this work, we presentAdaptiveVideoSuper-Resolution
 (Ada-VSR) which leverages external, as well as internal, information 
through meta-transfer learning and internal learning, respectively.

89, TITLE:	Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Reflecting Surface-assisted D2D Communications
AUTHORS:	KHOI KHAC NGUYEN et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI, cs.GT, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach 
for solving the optimisation problem of the network's sum-rate in 
device-to-device (D2D) communications supported by an intelligent 
reflecting surface (IRS).
