AUTHORS: SHUOLIN XU et. al.

88, TITLE: Beyond Optimal Transport: Model-Aligned Coupling for Flow Matching
AUTHORS: Yexiong Lin ; Yu Yao ; Tongliang Liu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, we observe that such geometry-based couplings do not necessarily align with the model's preferred trajectories, making it difficult to learn the vector field induced by these couplings, which prevents the model from learning straight trajectories. Motivated by this, we propose Model-Aligned Coupling (MAC), an effective method that matches training couplings based not only on geometric distance but also on alignment with the model's preferred transport directions based on its prediction error.

AUTHORS: Mohamad Alansari ; Sajid Javed ; Iyyakutti Iyappan Ganapathi ; Sara Alansari ; Muzammal Naseer
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the direct application of VLMs to VOT is hindered by critical limitations: the absence of a rich and comprehensive textual representation that semantically captures the target object's nuances, limiting the effective use of language information; inefficient fusion mechanisms that fail to optimally integrate visual and textual features, preventing a holistic understanding of the target; and a lack of temporal modeling of the target's evolving appearance in the language domain, leading to a disconnect between the initial description and the object's subsequent visual changes. To bridge these gaps and unlock the full potential of VLMs for VOT, we propose CLDTracker, a novel Comprehensive Language Description framework for robust visual Tracking.

AUTHORS: ZEYU LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, extending these achievements to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B.

To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a reverse curriculum, which does the opposite.

171, TITLE: HiGarment: Cross-modal Harmony Based Diffusion Model for Flat Sketch to Realistic Garment Image
AUTHORS: JUNYI GUO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: FS2RG presents two key challenges: 1) fabric characteristics are solely guided by textual prompts, providing insufficient visual supervision for diffusion-based models, which limits their ability to capture fine-grained fabric details; 2) flat sketches and textual guidance may provide conflicting information, requiring the model to selectively preserve or modify garment attributes while maintaining structural coherence. To tackle this task, we propose HiGarment, a novel framework that comprises two core components: i) a multi-modal semantic enhancement mechanism that enhances fabric representation across textual and visual modalities, and ii) a harmonized cross-attention mechanism that dynamically balances information from flat sketches and text prompts, allowing controllable synthesis by generating either sketch-aligned (image-biased) or text-guided (text-biased) outputs.

HIGHLIGHT: However, accuracy metrics alone do not support fine-grained assessment of capabilities and fail to reveal which problem-solving skills have been internalized. To better understand these capabilities, we propose to decompose problem solving into fundamental capabilities: Plan (mapping questions to sequences of steps), Execute (correctly performing solution steps), and Verify (identifying the correctness of a solution).

CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]

CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In several past years neural networks models such as YOLOv11 and Detectron2 have revolutionized visual data analysis, but their application to domain-specific cultural artifacts - such as manuscripts and incunabula - remains limited by the absence of methodologies that address structural feature extraction and semantic interoperability. In this position paper, we argue, that the integration of neural networks with semantic technologies represents a paradigm shift in cultural heritage digitization processes.

We prove this phenomenon theoretically from the perspective of knowledge graphs, showing that the test-time prompt may diminish or even overshadow the impact of fine-tuning data and play a dominant role in knowledge extraction.
