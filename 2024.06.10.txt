AUTHORS: Sangwon Ryu ; Heejin Do ; Yunsu Kim ; Gary Geunbae Lee ; Jungseul Ok
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In response, smaller-scale LLMs (sLLMs) of easy accessibility and low costs have been extensively studied, yet they often suffer from missing key information and entities, i.e., low relevance, in particular, when input documents are long. We hence propose a key-element-informed instruction tuning for summarization, so-called KEITSum, which identifies key elements in documents and instructs sLLM to generate summaries capturing these key elements.
