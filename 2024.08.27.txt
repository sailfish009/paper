AUTHORS: Tianyang Liu ; Tianyi Li ; Liang Cheng ; Mark Steedman

HIGHLIGHT: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reported to hold undesirable attestation bias on inference tasks: when asked to predict if a premise P entails a hypothesis H, instead of considering H's conditional truthfulness entailed by P, LLMs tend to use the out-of-context truth label of H as a fragile proxy. In this paper, we propose a pipeline that exploits this bias to do explicit inductive inference.

AUTHORS: Ali Mohammadi Esfahani ; Nafiseh Kahani ; Samuel A. Ajila
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This study investigates the reliability of code generation by Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on identifying and analyzing defects in the generated code.

313, TITLE: Analyzing The Impact of Splicing Artifacts in Partially Fake Speech Signals
AUTHORS: Viola Negroni ; Davide Salvi ; Paolo Bestagini ; Stefano Tubaro
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.MM, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: Our findings reveal that by analyzing splicing artifacts, we can achieve a detection EER of 6.16% and 7.36% on PartialSpoof and HAD datasets, respectively, without needing to train any detector.

314, TITLE: Studying The Effect of Audio Filters in Pre-Trained Models for Environmental Sound Classification
AUTHORS: Aditya Dawn ; Wazib Ansar
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a new methodology : Two-Level Classification; the Level 1 Classifier will be responsible to classify the audio signal into a broader class and the Level 2 Classifiers will be responsible to find the actual class to which the audio belongs, based on the output of the Level 1 Classifier.

315, TITLE: Literary and Colloquial Tamil Dialect Identification
AUTHORS: M. Nanmalar ; P. Vijayalakshmi ; T. Nagarajan
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.HC, cs.LG, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: Dialect Identification (DID) of LT and CT is an unexplored area of research. In the current work, keeping the nuances of both these dialects in mind, five methods are explored which include two implicit methods - Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); two explicit methods - Parallel Phone Recognition (PPR) and Parallel Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (P-LVCSR); two versions of the proposed explicit Unified Phone Recognition method (UPR-1 and UPR-2).

316, TITLE: HER2 and FISH Status Prediction in Breast Biopsy H&E-Stained Images Using Deep Learning
AUTHORS: ARDHENDU SEKHAR et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we employed a customized weak supervision classification technique combined with MoCo-v2 contrastive learning to predict HER2 status.
