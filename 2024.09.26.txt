AUTHORS: Nicolas Abboud ; Malak Sayour ; Imad H. Elhajj ; John Zelek ; Daniel Asmar
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV, cs.SY, eess.SY]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents an integrated approach to Visual SLAM, merging online sequential photometric calibration within a Hybrid direct-indirect visual SLAM (H-SLAM).

237, TITLE: On The Role of Artificial Intelligence Methods in Modern Force-controlled Manufacturing Robotic Tasks
AUTHORS: Vincenzo Petrone ; Enrico Ferrentino ; Pasquale Chiacchio
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: AI's role in enhancing robotic manipulators - key drivers in the Fourth Industrial Revolution - is rapidly leading to significant innovations in smart manufacturing. The objective of this article is to frame these innovations in practical force-controlled applications - e.g. deburring, polishing, and assembly tasks like peg-in-hole (PiH) - highlighting their necessity for maintaining high-quality production standards.

AUTHORS: Sara Incao ; Carlo Mazzola ; Giulia Belgiovine ; Alessandra Sciutti
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.HC, I.2.7; I.2.9; J.4; F.3.2; D.3.1]
HIGHLIGHT: Taking inspiration from humans, this work draws attention to three necessary elements for an agent to grasp and experience the world.

239, TITLE: Robotic Backchanneling in Online Conversation Facilitation: A Cross-Generational Study
AUTHORS: SOTA KOBUKI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CL, cs.HC]
HIGHLIGHT: We modified the robot to use backchannelling, a natural human way of speaking, to increase receptiveness of the robot and enjoyment of the group conversation experience.

240, TITLE: The Effect of Perceptual Metrics on Music Representation Learning for Genre Classification
AUTHORS: Tashi Namgyal ; Alexander Hepburn ; Raul Santos-Rodriguez ; Valero Laparra ; Jesus Malo
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: Models trained with perceptual metrics as loss functions can capture perceptually meaningful features from the structures held within these metrics. We demonstrate that using features extracted from autoencoders trained with perceptual losses can improve performance on music understanding tasks, i.e. genre classification, over using these metrics directly as distances when learning a classifier.

241, TITLE: To Explore The Potential Inhibitors Against Multitarget Proteins of COVID 19 Using In Silico Study
AUTHORS: Imra Aqeel
CATEGORY: q-bio.QM [q-bio.QM, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we used the combination of molecular docking and machine learning regression approaches to explore the potential inhibitors for the treatment of COVID 19.

242, TITLE: ECG-Image-Database: A Dataset of ECG Images with Real-World Imaging and Scanning Artifacts; A Foundation for Computerized ECG Image Digitization and Analysis
AUTHORS: MATTHEW A. REYNA et. al.
CATEGORY: q-bio.QM [q-bio.QM, cs.AI, eess.IV, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce the ECG-Image-Database, a large and diverse collection of electrocardiogram (ECG) images generated from ECG time-series data, with real-world scanning, imaging, and physical artifacts.

243, TITLE: Let There Be Light: Robust Lensless Imaging Under External Illumination With Deep Learning
AUTHORS: Eric Bezzam ; Stefan Peters ; Martin Vetterli
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To this end, we propose multiple recovery approaches that account for external illumination by incorporating its estimate into the image recovery process.

244, TITLE: The Effect of Lossy Compression on 3D Medical Images Segmentation with Deep Learning
AUTHORS: Anvar Kurmukov ; Bogdan Zavolovich ; Aleksandra Dalechina ; Vladislav Proskurov ; Boris Shirokikh
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Using three CT datasets (17 tasks) and one MRI dataset (3 tasks) we demonstrate that lossy compression up to 20 times have no negative impact on segmentation quality with deep neural networks (DNN).

245, TITLE: A Novel Open-source Ultrasound Dataset with Deep Learning Benchmarks for Spinal Cord Injury Localization and Anatomical Segmentation
AUTHORS: AVISHA KUMAR et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To further facilitate medical machine learning, we present an ultrasound dataset of 10,223 Brightness-mode (B-mode) images consisting of sagittal slices of porcine spinal cords (N=25) before and after a contusion injury.

246, TITLE: Going Beyond U-Net: Assessing Vision Transformers for Semantic Segmentation in Microscopy Image Analysis
AUTHORS: Illia Tsiporenko ; Pavel Chizhov ; Dmytro Fishman
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While U-Net remains one of the most popular and well-established models for biomedical segmentation tasks, recently developed transformer-based models promise to enhance the segmentation process of microscopy images. In this work, we assess the efficacy of transformers, including UNETR, the Segment Anything Model, and Swin-UPerNet, and compare them with the well-established U-Net model across various image modalities such as electron microscopy, brightfield, histopathology, and phase-contrast.
