AUTHORS: Mohsinul Kabir; Tasnim Ahmed; Md Mezbaur Rahman; Polydoros Giannouris; Sophia Ananiadou
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: While sentiment preservation in translation has long beenstudied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignmentbetween source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize thatsemantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutraldomains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modernLarge Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MTtools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge canamplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity betweensource and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation.
