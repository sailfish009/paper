AUTHORS: DANIEL WURGAFT et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Specifically, we start with the observation thatwhen trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, thestrategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family ofBayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior onthe set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matchesthe underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis fromcognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimaladaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchicalBayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next tokenpredictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights.

310, TITLE: Adaptive Mask-guided K-space Diffusion for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction
AUTHORS: QINRONG CAI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, previous MRI reconstructionstrategies usually optimized the entire image domain or k-space, withoutconsidering the importance of different frequency regions in the k-space Thiswork introduces a diffusion model based on adaptive masks (AMDM), whichutilizes the adaptive adjustment of frequency distribution based on k-spacedata to develop a hybrid masks mechanism that adapts to different k-spaceinputs. This enables the effective separation of high-frequency andlow-frequency components, producing diverse frequency-specific representations.Additionally, the k-space frequency distribution informs the generation ofadaptive masks, which, in turn, guide a closed-loop diffusion process.Experimental results verified the ability of this method to learn specificfrequency information and thereby improved the quality of MRI reconstruction,providing a flexible framework for optimizing k-space data using masks in thefuture.

CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: To address theseissues, we propose a training scheme that leverages self-supervised learningmodels for robust feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and knowledgedistillation.

450, TITLE: DSA-NRP: No-Reflow Prediction from Angiographic Perfusion Dynamics in Stroke EVT
AUTHORS: SHREERAM ATHREYA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we introduce the first-ever machinelearning (ML) framework to predict no-reflow immediately after EVT byleveraging previously unexplored intra-procedural digital subtractionangiography (DSA) sequences and clinical variables.
