AUTHORS: Peter Baile Chen ; Yi Zhang ; Michael Cafarella ; Dan Roth
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.IR]
HIGHLIGHT: While this provides one way of interacting with the data collection, agentic RAG's exploration of data is inefficient because successive queries depend on previous results rather than being guided by the organization of available data in the collection. To address this problem, we propose an LLM-based retrieval method -- ARM, that aims to better align the question with the organization of the data collection by exploring relationships among data objects beyond matching the utterance of the query, thus leading to a retrieve-all-at-once solution for complex queries.

118, TITLE: On Scaling Neurosymbolic Programming Through Guided Logical Inference
AUTHORS: Thomas Jean-Michel Valentin ; Luisa Sophie Werner ; Pierre Genev�s ; Nabil Laya�da
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Many state-of-the-art systems rely on a reduction to the Probabilistic Weighted Model Counting Problem (PWMC), which requires computing a Boolean formula called the logical provenance.However, PWMC is \\#P-hard, and the number of clauses in the logical provenance formula can grow exponentially, creating a major bottleneck that significantly limits the applicability of PNL solutions in practice.We propose a new approach centered around an exact algorithm DPNL, that enables bypassing the computation of the logical provenance.The DPNL approach relies on the principles of an oracle and a recursive DPLL-like decomposition in order to guide and speed up logical inference.Furthermore, we show that this approach can be adapted for approximate reasoning with $\epsilon$ or $(\epsilon, \delta)$ guarantees, called ApproxDPNL.Experiments show significant performance gains.DPNL enables scaling exact inference further, resulting in more accurate models.Further, ApproxDPNL shows potential for advancing the scalability of neurosymbolic programming by incorporating approximations even further, while simultaneously ensuring guarantees for the reasoning process.
