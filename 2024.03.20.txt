207, TITLE: Embarrassingly Simple Scribble Supervision for 3D Medical Segmentation
AUTHORS: KAROL GOTKOWSKI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We relate this shortcoming to two major issues: 1) the complex nature of many methods which deeply ties them to the underlying segmentation model, thus preventing a migration to more powerful state-of-the-art models as the field progresses and 2) the lack of a systematic evaluation to validate consistent performance across the broader medical domain, resulting in a lack of trust when applying these methods to new segmentation problems. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive scribble supervision benchmark consisting of seven datasets covering a diverse set of anatomies and pathologies imaged with varying modalities.
