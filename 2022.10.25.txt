77, TITLE: Joint Coreference Resolution for Zeros and Non-Zeros in Arabic
AUTHORS: Abdulrahman Aloraini ; Sameer Pradhan ; Massimo Poesio
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: The main issues that need tackling to develop a joint model for zero and non-zero mentions are the difference between the two types of arguments (zero pronouns, being null, provide no nominal information) and the lack of annotated datasets of a suitable size in which both types of arguments are annotated for languages other than Chinese and Japanese. In this paper, we introduce two architectures for jointly resolving AZPs and non-AZPs, and evaluate them on Arabic, a language for which, as far as we know, there has been no prior work on joint resolution.

AUTHORS: Yue Yang ; Artemis Panagopoulou ; Marianna Apidianaki ; Mark Yatskar ; Chris Callison-Burch
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Common properties of nouns (e.g., red strawberries, small ant) are, however, more challenging to extract compared to other types of knowledge because they are rarely explicitly stated in texts.

In this work, we propose a first step towards such a theory that incorporates different sources of uncertainty, such as imperfect automated metrics and insufficiently sized test sets.

115, TITLE: Hard Gate Knowledge Distillation -- Leverage Calibration for Robust and Reliable Language Model
AUTHORS: Dongkyu Lee ; Zhiliang Tian ; Yingxiu Zhao ; Ka Chun Cheung ; Nevin L. Zhang
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Knowledge of a teacher is considered a subject that holds inter-class relations which send a meaningful supervision to a student; hence, much effort has been put to find such knowledge to be distilled.

119, TITLE: Generative Prompt Tuning for Relation Classification
AUTHORS: Jiale Han ; Shuai Zhao ; Bo Cheng ; Shengkun Ma ; Wei Lu
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Inspired by the text infilling task for pre-training generative models that can flexibly predict missing spans, we propose a novel generative prompt tuning method to reformulate relation classification as an infilling problem, which frees our approach from limitations of current prompt based approaches and thus fully exploits rich semantics of entity and relation types.

120, TITLE: Multilingual Auxiliary Tasks Training: Bridging The Gap Between Languages for Zero-Shot Transfer of Hate Speech Detection Models
AUTHORS: Syrielle Montariol ; Arij Riabi ; Djamé Seddah

140, TITLE: Syntactic Surprisal From Neural Models Predicts, But Underestimates, Human Processing Difficulty From Syntactic Ambiguities
AUTHORS: Suhas Arehalli ; Brian Dillon ; Tal Linzen
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Challenging this hypothesis, van Schijndel & Linzen (2021) find that estimates of the cost of word predictability derived from language models severely underestimate the magnitude of human garden path effects. In this work, we consider whether this underestimation is due to the fact that humans weight syntactic factors in their predictions more highly than language models do.

151, TITLE: Structural Generalization Is Hard for Sequence-to-sequence Models
AUTHORS: Yuekun Yao ; Alexander Koller
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, recent work on compositional generalization has shown that seq2seq models achieve very low accuracy in generalizing to linguistic structures that were not seen in training. We present new evidence that this is a general limitation of seq2seq models that is present not just in semantic parsing, but also in syntactic parsing and in text-to-text tasks, and that this limitation can often be overcome by neurosymbolic models that have linguistic knowledge built in.

CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.FL, cs.SC]
HIGHLIGHT: While large-scale communication models, such as causal ordering, are defined by logical axioms, local-scale models are often defined by an operational semantics. In this work, we connect these two approaches, and we present a unified hierarchy of communication models encompassing both large-scale and local-scale models, based on their non-sequential behaviors.

167, TITLE: Towards Generalizable and Robust Text-to-SQL Parsing
AUTHORS: CHANG GAO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: In specific, we believe that text-to-SQL parsers should be (1) generalizable at three levels of generalization, namely i.i.d., zero-shot, and compositional, and (2) robust against input perturbations. To enhance these capabilities of the parser, we propose a novel TKK framework consisting of Task decomposition, Knowledge acquisition, and Knowledge composition to learn text-to-SQL parsing in stages.

173, TITLE: On The Limitations of Reference-Free Evaluations of Generated Text
AUTHORS: Daniel Deutsch ; Rotem Dror ; Dan Roth
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We show how reference-free metrics are equivalent to using one generation model to evaluate another, which has several limitations: (1) the metrics can be optimized at test time to find the approximate best-possible output, (2) they are inherently biased toward models which are more similar to their own, and (3) they can be biased against higher-quality outputs, including those written by humans. Therefore, we recommend that reference-free metrics should be used as diagnostic tools for analyzing and understanding model behavior instead of measures of how well models perform a task, in which the goal is to achieve as high of a score as possible.

To bridge this gap, we propose SurCo that learns linear Surrogate costs which can be used by existing Combinatorial solvers to output good solutions to the original nonlinear combinatorial optimization problem, combining the flexibility of gradient-based methods with the structure of linear combinatorial optimization.

HIGHLIGHT: The exploitation of these schemes can lead to the introduction of algorithms capable of optimizing the trajectory of a Visual SLAM system and also helping to construct an exuberant map. Thus, we present a real-time monocular Visual SLAM system that incorporates real-time methods for line and VP extraction, as well as two strategies that exploit vanishing points to estimate the robot's translation and improve its rotation.Particularly, we build on ORB-SLAM2, which is considered the current state-of-the-art solution in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, and extend its formulation to handle lines and VPs to create two strategies the first optimize the rotation and the second refine the translation part from the known rotation.
