In this work, we make progress towards this question by considering certain two-layered circuit compositions of $\mathrm{MOD}[k]$ gates, where we show that these family of circuits are fooled by expander random walks with total variation distance error $O(\lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the second largest eigenvalue of the underlying expander graph.
