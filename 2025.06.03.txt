HIGHLIGHT: Robust causal reasoning is fundamental to solving complex high-level reasoning tasks, yet existing benchmarks often include a mixture of reasoning questions, and VLMs can frequently exploit object recognition and activity identification as shortcuts to arrive at the correct answers, making it challenging to truly assess their causal reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce VQA-Causal and VCR-Causal, two new benchmarks specifically designed to isolate and rigorously evaluate VLMs' causal reasoning abilities.

HIGHLIGHT: Despite the empirical success of Diffusion Models (DMs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), their generalization performance remains theoretically underexplored, especially lacking a full consideration of the shared encoder-generator structure. Leveraging recent information-theoretic tools, we propose a unified theoretical framework that provides guarantees for the generalization of both the encoder and generator by treating them as randomized mappings.

85, TITLE: Accelerating Diffusion LLMs Via Adaptive Parallel Decoding

HIGHLIGHT: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) can be employed to simulate character thought, their direct application is hindered by attention diversion (i.e., RPAs forget their role) and style drift (i.e., overly formal and rigid reasoning rather than character-consistent reasoning). To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Role-Aware Reasoning (RAR) method, which consists of two important stages: Role Identity Activation (RIA) and Reasoning Style Optimization (RSO).

CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, I.2.7]
HIGHLIGHT: We reexamine the perplexity based paradigm for text generation under noisy annotations, highlighting two sources of bias in perplexity: the annotation itself and the domain specific knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs). To overcome these biases, we introduce a dual debiasing framework that uses synthesized neighbors to explicitly correct perplexity estimates, yielding a robust Sample Cleanliness Score.

CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, state-of-the-art approaches either struggle to generalize beyond demonstration datasets (e.g., imitation learning methods) or fail to generate physically grounded actions (e.g., VLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce WoMAP (World Models for Active Perception): a recipe for training open-vocabulary object localization policies that: (i) uses a Gaussian Splatting-based real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for scalable data generation without the need for expert demonstrations, (ii) distills dense rewards signals from open-vocabulary object detectors, and (iii) leverages a latent world model for dynamics and rewards prediction to ground high-level action proposals at inference time.

AUTHORS: Peng Hui ; Jiamuyang Zhao ; Changxin Li ; Qingzhen Zhu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the difference between the two kinds of features does not have an independent and clear meaning, and the amount of learning is based on the absolute rather than the relative difference, which is sensitive to the size of existing features. We propose a new network that perfectly solves these two problems while still having the advantages of ResNet.

HIGHLIGHT: This duality requires a model to learn representing and deciding between the two meanings to interpret an idiom in a figurative sense, or literally. In this paper, we employ tools from mechanistic interpretability to trace how a large pretrained causal transformer (LLama3.2-1B-base) deals with this ambiguity.

127, TITLE: Breaking Latent Prior Bias in Detectors for Generalizable AIGC Image Detection
AUTHORS: YUE ZHOU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We trace this failure in part to latent prior bias: detectors learn shortcuts tied to patterns stemming from the initial noise vector rather than learning robust generative artifacts. To address this, we propose On-Manifold Adversarial Training (OMAT): by optimizing the initial latent noise of diffusion models under fixed conditioning, we generate on-manifold adversarial examples that remain on the generator's output manifold-unlike pixel-space attacks, which introduce off-manifold perturbations that the generator itself cannot reproduce and that can obscure the true discriminative artifacts.

147, TITLE: Do Language Models Mirror Human Confidence? Exploring Psychological Insights to Address Overconfidence in LLMs
AUTHORS: CHENJUN XU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, I.2.7]
HIGHLIGHT: We examine three LLMs, Llama-3-70B-instruct, Claude-3-Sonnet, and GPT-4o, on a range of QA tasks of varying difficulty, and show that models exhibit subtle differences from human patterns of overconfidence: less sensitive to task difficulty, and when prompted to answer based on different personas -- e.g., expert vs layman, or different race, gender, and ages -- the models will respond with stereotypically biased confidence estimations even though their underlying answer accuracy remains the same. Based on these observations, we propose Answer-Free Confidence Estimation (AFCE) to improve confidence calibration and LLM interpretability in these settings.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for LLM detoxification, which leverages a compact, pre-trained calibration model that guides the detoxification process of a target LLM via a lightweight intervention in its generation pipeline.
