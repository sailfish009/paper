HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents a novel approach for predicting tongue and lip articulatory features involved in a given speech acoustics using a stacked Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architecture, combined with a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for post-processing with fixed weights initialization.

154, TITLE: Predicting Dairy Calf Body Weight from Depth Images Using Deep Learning (YOLOv8) and Threshold Segmentation with Cross-Validation and Longitudinal Analysis
AUTHORS: Mingsi Liao ; Gota Morota ; Ye Bi ; Rebecca R. Cockrum
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The objectives of this study were to (1) develop deep learning-based segmentation models for extracting calf body metrics, (2) compare deep learning segmentation with threshold-based methods, and (3) evaluate BW prediction using single-time-point cross-validation with linear regression (LR) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and multiple-time-point cross-validation with LR, XGBoost, and a linear mixed model (LMM).

155, TITLE: Towards A Deep Learning Approach for Classifying Treatment Response in Glioblastomas
AUTHORS: ANA MATOSO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The models were trained and tested on the open dataset LUMIERE.

156, TITLE: HepatoGEN: Generating Hepatobiliary Phase MRI with Perceptual and Adversarial Models
AUTHORS: JENS HOOGE et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we propose a deep learning based approach for synthesizing HBP images from earlier contrast phases (precontrast and transitional) and compare three generative models: a perceptual U-Net, a perceptual GAN (pGAN), and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM).
