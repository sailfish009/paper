78, TITLE: Actor-Critics Can Achieve Optimal Sample Efficiency
AUTHORS: Kevin Tan ; Wei Fan ; Yuting Wei

We address this open problem by introducing a novel actor-critic algorithm that attains a sample-complexity of $O(dH^5 \log|\mathcal{A}|/\epsilon^2 + d H^4 \log|\mathcal{F}|/ \epsilon^2)$ trajectories, and accompanying $\sqrt{T}$ regret when the Bellman eluder dimension $d$ does not increase with $T$ at more than a $\log T$ rate.
