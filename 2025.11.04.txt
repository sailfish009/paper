HIGHLIGHT: Identifying/retrieving relevant statutes and prior cases/precedents for agiven legal situation are common tasks exercised by law practitioners.Researchers to date have addressed the two tasks independently, thus developingcompletely different datasets and models for each task; however, both retrievaltasks are inherently related, e.g., similar cases tend to cite similar statutes(due to similar factual situation). In this paper, we address this gap.

AUTHORS: Huiting Huang; Tieliang Gong; Kai He; Jialun Wu; Erik Cambria; Mengling Feng
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite advancements in algorithm design, existingapproaches suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient learning ofnoise-contaminated unimodal data, leading to corrupted cross-modalinteractions, and inadequate fusion of multimodal representations, resulting indiscarding discriminative unimodal information while retaining multimodalredundant information.

AUTHORS: Shengqi Xu; Xinpeng Zhou; Yabo Zhang; Ming Liu; Tao Liang; Tianyu Zhang; Yalong Bai; Zuxuan Wu; Wangmeng Zuo
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]

This review examines this convergence across threeprinciples: automaticity, in which responses emerge from associative ratherthan deliberative processes; suppressed monitoring, leading to errors such asconfabulation in hypnosis and hallucination in LLMs; and heightened contextualdependency, where immediate cues (for example, the suggestion of a therapist orthe prompt of the user) override stable knowledge.

AUTHORS: Oluwatosin Alabi; Meng Wei; Charlie Budd; Tom Vercauteren; Miaojing Shi
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Understanding surgical instrument-tissue interactions requires not onlyidentifying which instrument performs which action on which anatomical target,but also grounding these interactions spatially within the surgical scene.Existing surgical action triplet recognition methods are limited to learningfrom frame-level classification, failing to reliably link actions to specificinstrument instances.Previous attempts at spatial grounding have primarilyrelied on class activation maps, which lack the precision and robustnessrequired for detailed instrument-tissue interaction analysis.To address thisgap, we propose grounding surgical action triplets with instrument instancesegmentation, or triplet segmentation for short, a new unified task whichproduces spatially grounded outputs.We start bypresenting CholecTriplet-Seg, a large-scale dataset containing over 30,000annotated frames, linking instrument instance masks with action verb andanatomical target annotations, and establishing the first benchmark forstrongly supervised, instance-level triplet grounding and evaluation.To learntriplet segmentation, we propose TargetFusionNet, a novel architecture thatextends Mask2Former with a target-aware fusion mechanism to address thechallenge of accurate anatomical target prediction by fusing weak anatomypriors with instrument instance queries.Evaluated across recognition,detection, and triplet segmentation metrics, TargetFusionNet consistentlyimproves performance over existing baselines, demonstrating that stronginstance supervision combined with weak target priors significantly enhancesthe accuracy and robustness of surgical action understanding.Tripletsegmentation establishes a unified framework for spatially grounding surgicalaction triplets.

506, TITLE: Random Initialization of Gated Sparse Adapters
AUTHORS: Vi Retault; Yohaï-Eliel Berreby

HIGHLIGHT: When fine-tuning language models on new tasks, catastrophic forgetting --performance degradation on previously-learned tasks -- is a ubiquitous problem.While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA address thisthrough low-rank adapters, sparse adaptation offers an alternative that doesn'timpose rank constraints. We introduce Random Initialization of Gated SparseAdapters (RIGSA), which starts from randomly-initialized full-rank adapters,gates them with a ReZero analog, and sparsifies them with iterative magnitudepruning.

522, TITLE: Attention Saturation and Gradient Suppression at Inflection Layers: Diagnosing and Mitigating Bottlenecks in Transformer Adaptation
AUTHORS: Wang Zixian
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Weformalize the mechanism of output saturation leading to gradient suppressionthrough standard cross-entropy and softmax analysis, showing that gradientsuppression at inflection layers confines adaptation to high-levelrecombination of existing features while preventing low-level reconstruction.We introduce a set of layer-wise diagnostic metrics -- attention entropy(saturation proxy), activation gradient norm, parameter gradient norm, andDelta-CKA under a shared PCA basis -- to identify inflection layerscharacterized by both low attention entropy and steep gradient decay. Buildingon these findings, we propose a diagnose-first, inject-light fine-tuningstrategy: selectively inserting LoRA adapters at inflection layers to restoresuppressed backward signals with minimal parameter overhead.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.SE [SE]
HIGHLIGHT: The integration of AI for Requirements Engineering (RE) presents significantbenefits but also poses real challenges.Although RE is fundamental to softwareengineering, limited research has examined AI adoption in RE.We surveyed 55software practitioners to map AI usage across four RE phases:Elicitation,Analysis, Specification, and Validation, and four approaches for decisionmaking: human only decisions, AI validation, Human AI Collaboration (HAIC), andfull AI automation.Participants also shared their perceptions, challenges, andopportunities when applying AI for RE tasks.Our data show that 58.2% ofrespondents already use AI in RE, and 69.1% view its impact as positive or verypositive.HAIC dominates practice, accounting for 54.4% of all RE techniques,while full AI automation remains minimal at 5.4%.
