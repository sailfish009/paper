AUTHORS: Zhi-Yuan Chen ; Hao Wang ; Xinyu Zhang ; Enrui Hu ; Yankai Lin

To address this issue, we introduce gold judgments as proxies for the actual quality of responses and propose the DBG score, which measures self-preference bias as the difference between the scores assigned by the judge model to its own responses and the corresponding gold judgments.

Instead, we propose a new non-convex total variation term in a graph setting (NC-GTV), such that when combined with an $\ell_2$-norm fidelity term for denoising, leads to a convex objective with no extraneous local minima.
