AUTHORS: Qianhao Han ; Junyi Liu ; Zengchang Qin ; Zheng Zheng
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Automating radiology report generation can significantly reduce the workload of radiologists and enhance the accuracy, consistency, and efficiency of clinical documentation.We propose a novel cross-modal framework that uses MedCLIP as both a vision extractor and a retrieval mechanism to improve the process of medical report generation.By extracting retrieved report features and image features through an attention-based extract module, and integrating them with a fusion module, our method improves the coherence and clinical relevance of generated reports.Experimental results on the widely used IU-Xray dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing improvements over commonly used methods in both report quality and relevance.Additionally, ablation studies provide further validation of the framework, highlighting the importance of accurate report retrieval and feature integration in generating comprehensive medical reports.

To tackle this gap, this work aims to leverage multiple attention mechanisms to hierarchically enhance the triple discriminative awareness of the YOLO detection head and complementarily learn the coordinated intermediate representations, resulting in a new series detectors denoted 3A-YOLO.
