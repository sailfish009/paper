158, TITLE: Segment Anything Model for Automated Image Data Annotation: Empirical Studies Using Text Prompts from Grounding DINO
AUTHORS: Fuseini Mumuni ; Alhassan Mumuni

HIGHLIGHT: To this end, we perform empirical studies on eight publicly available datasets and reveal that these errors consistently follow a predictable pattern and can, thus, be mitigated by a simple strategy.

159, TITLE: Enhancing Continual Learning in Visual Question Answering with Modality-Aware Feature Distillation
AUTHORS: Malvina Nikandrou ; Georgios Pantazopoulos ; Ioannis Konstas ; Alessandro Suglia
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing approaches at the intersection of Continual Learning and Visual Question Answering (VQA) do not study how the multimodal nature of the input affects the learning dynamics of a model. In this paper, we demonstrate that each modality evolves at different rates across a continuum of tasks and that this behavior occurs in established encoder-only models as well as modern recipes for developing Vision & Language (VL) models.

160, TITLE: ProtoGMM: Multi-prototype Gaussian-Mixture-based Domain Adaptation Model for Semantic Segmentation
AUTHORS: Nazanin Moradinasab ; Laura S. Shankman ; Rebecca A. Deaton ; Gary K. Owens ; Donald E. Brown
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While many methods focus on mitigating the issue of noisy pseudo-labels, they often overlook the underlying data distribution p(pixel feature|class) in both the source and target domains. To address this limitation, we propose the multi-prototype Gaussian-Mixture-based (ProtoGMM) model, which incorporates the GMM into contrastive losses to perform guided contrastive learning.

171, TITLE: Towards Reducing Data Acquisition and Labeling for Defect Detection Using Simulated Data
AUTHORS: Lukas Malte Kemeter ; Rasmus Hvingelby ; Paulina Sierak ; Tobias Sch�n ; Bishwajit Gosswam
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, relying solely on synthetic data is frequently inadequate for effectively training models that perform well on real-world data, primarily due to domain shifts between the synthetic and real-world data. We discuss approaches for dealing with such a domain shift when detecting defects in X-ray scans of aluminium wheels.

174, TITLE: Resolving Discrepancies in Compute-Optimal Scaling of Language Models
AUTHORS: Tomer Porian ; Mitchell Wortsman ; Jenia Jitsev ; Ludwig Schmidt ; Yair Carmon
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We explain the discrepancy by reproducing the Kaplan scaling law on two datasets (OpenWebText2 and RefinedWeb) and identifying three factors causing the difference: last layer computational cost, warmup duration, and scale-dependent optimizer tuning. With these factors corrected, we obtain excellent agreement with the Hoffmann et al. (i.e., "Chinchilla") scaling law.

We address these challenges by using the segmentation masks of a few incomplete sagittal-plane US scans of the liver in conjunction with a statistical shape model (SSM) built using a set of CT scans of the liver.
