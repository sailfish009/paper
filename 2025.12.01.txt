CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, two critical challenges persist: (1) instruction hallucination, text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning cannot fully prevent factual errors due to inherent information bottlenecks; (2) reward hacking, dynamic policy optimization against static reward models allows agents to exploit flaws in reward functions. To address these issues, we propose JarvisEvo, a unified image editing agent that emulates an expert human designer by iteratively editing, selecting appropriate tools, evaluating results, and reflecting on its own decisions to refine outcomes.

HIGHLIGHT: However, it remains constrained by issues such as context window length, inference cost, and format hallucination. We present Dripper, an efficient HTML main content extraction framework powered by lightweight language models, which addresses these challenges through four key innovations: (1) We design a specialized HTML simplification algorithm that reduces input token count to 22\% compared to raw HTML while preserving critical structural information; (2) We reformulate main content extraction as a semantic block sequence classification task, significantly reducing inference cost; (3) We introduce a controlled decoding mechanism that strictly constrains the output space through logits processors, effectively eliminating hallucination issues common in small-scale models; (4) We propose WebMainBench, an evaluation dataset containing over 7,800 web pages with meticulously human-annotated main content extraction labels.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Current vision-language embodied agents lack ToM-based decision-making, and existing benchmarks focus solely on human mental states while ignoring the agent's own perspective, hindering coherent decision and action generation.

27, TITLE: MultiBanana: A Challenging Benchmark for Multi-Reference Text-to-Image Generation
AUTHORS: Yuta Oshima; Daiki Miyake; Kohsei Matsutani; Yusuke Iwasawa; Masahiro Suzuki; Yutaka Matsuo; Hiroki Furuta
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In addition, their task definitions are still vague, typically limited to axes such as "what to edit" or "how many references are given", and therefore fail to capture the intrinsic difficulty of multi-reference settings. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiBanana}$, which is carefully designed to assesses the edge of model capabilities by widely covering multi-reference-specific problems at scale: (1) varying the number of references, (2) domain mismatch among references (e.g., photo vs. anime), (3) scale mismatch between reference and target scenes, (4) references containing rare concepts (e.g., a red banana), and (5) multilingual textual references for rendering.

AUTHORS: Bao Shu; Yan Cai; Jianjian Sun; Chunrui Han; En Yu; Liang Zhao; Jingcheng Hu; Yinmin Zhang; Haoran Lv; Yuang Peng; Zheng Ge; Xiangyu Zhang; Daxin Jiang; Xiangyu Yue
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues.

369, TITLE: Fairness in The Multi-Secretary Problem
AUTHORS: Georgios Papasotiropoulos; Zein Pishbin

After identifying the limitations of the prominent proportionality notion of Extended Justified Representation (EJR) in the online domain, the work proposes a set of mechanisms that merge techniques from online algorithms with rules from social choice -- such as the Method of Equal Shares and the Nash Rule -- and supports them through both theoretical analysis and extensive experimental evaluation.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Multi-chain Graph Refinement & Selection (MGRS), which first generates multiple diverse reasoning trajectories for a given problem, refines candidate responses using a composite self- and cross-verification strategy, then constructs a reasoning relation graph and estimates the success rate of intermediate nodes, and finally computes cumulative success rates to select the most reliable answer and corresponding reasoning trajectory.

379, TITLE: Buffer Replay Enhances The Robustness of Multimodal Learning Under Missing-modality
AUTHORS: Hongye Zhu; Xuan Liu; Yanwen Ba; Jingye Xue; Shigeng Zhang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing approaches either synthesize missing modalities at high computational cost or apply prompt-based fine-tuning that relies only on adjacent-layer features and overlooks long-distance contextual information, which may offer additional tolerance to errors when one or more modalities are missing. To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While recent approaches attempt to handle irrelevant queries, they can only reject those that are entirely unrelated to the video and still fail to handle hard-irrelevant queries that are semantically similar but not actually relevant. To address this, we propose Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) to effectively refuse hard-irrelevant queries in VTG.

AUTHORS: Vinh Chau; Khoa Le Dinh Van; Hon Huynh Ngoc; Binh Nguyen Thien; Hao Nguyen Thien; Vy Nguyen Quang; Phuc Vo Hong; Yen Lam Minh; Kieu Pham Tieu; Trinh Nguyen Thi Diem; Louise Thwaites; Hai Ho Bich
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In many low-resource healthcare settings, bedside monitors remain standalone legacy devices without network connectivity, creating a persistent interoperability gap that prevents seamless integration of physiological data into electronic health record (EHR) systems. To address this challenge without requiring costly hardware replacement, we present a computer vision-based pipeline for the automated capture and digitisation of vital sign data directly from bedside monitor screens.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing detectors often suffer from missed detections and false positives in such scenarios. To address these issues, we propose DAONet-YOLOv8, an enhanced YOLOv8 variant with three key improvements: (1) a Dual-Attention Fusion Module (DAFM) that combines convolutional local feature extraction with self-attention based global context modeling to focus on subtle lesion regions while suppressing background noise; (2) an occlusion-aware detection head (Detect-OAHead) that learns the relationship between visible and occluded parts to compensate for missing lesion features; and (3) a C2f-DSConv module employing dynamic synthesis convolutions with multiple kernel shapes to better capture irregular lesion boundaries.

To address this challenge, we propose ReImage, a neural watermarking-based self-recovery framework that embeds a shuffled version of the target image into itself as a watermark.

655, TITLE: Object-Centric Data Synthesis for Category-level Object Detection
AUTHORS: Vikhyat Agarwal; Jiayi Cora Guo; Declan Hoban; Sissi Zhang; Nicholas Moran; Peter Cho; Srilakshmi Pattabiraman; Shantanu Joshi
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, extending a model's detection capability to new object classes requires large amounts of annotated training data, which is costly and time-consuming to acquire, especially for long-tailed classes with insufficient representation in existing datasets. Here, we introduce the object-centric data setting, when limited data is available in the form of object-centric data (multi-view images or 3D models), and systematically evaluate the performance of four different data synthesis methods to finetune object detection models on novel object categories in this setting.
