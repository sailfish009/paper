48, TITLE: Heatmap Distribution Matching for Human Pose Estimation
AUTHORS: Haoxuan Qu ; Li Xu ; Yujun Cai ; Lin Geng Foo ; Jun Liu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: For tackling the task of 2D human pose estimation, the great majority of the recent methods regard this task as a heatmap estimation problem, and optimize the heatmap prediction using the Gaussian-smoothed heatmap as the optimization objective and using the pixel-wise loss (e.g. MSE) as the loss function. In this paper, we show that optimizing the heatmap prediction in such a way, the model performance of body joint localization, which is the intrinsic objective of this task, may not be consistently improved during the optimization process of the heatmap prediction.

51, TITLE: Smooth Image-to-image Translations with Latent Space Interpolations
AUTHORS: YAHUI LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, state-of-the-art methods usually perform poorly when evaluated using inter-domain interpolations, often producing abrupt changes in the appearance or non-realistic intermediate images. In this paper, we argue that one of the main reasons behind this problem is the lack of sufficient inter-domain training data and we propose two different regularization methods to alleviate this issue: a new shrinkage loss, which compacts the latent space, and a Mixup data-augmentation strategy, which flattens the style representations between domains.

In the present study, therefore, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the shape of the target object using minimal data.
