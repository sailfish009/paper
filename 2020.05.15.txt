AUTHORS:        Thibault Sellam ; Dipanjan Das ; Ankur P. Parikh
COMMENTS:       Accepted at ACL 2020

53, TITLE:      A Locally Adaptive Interpretable Regression
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03350
AUTHORS:        Lkhagvadorj Munkhdalai ; Tsendsuren Munkhdalai ; Keun Ho Ryu

54, TITLE:      DeepFaceLab: A simple, flexible and extensible face swapping framework
http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05535
AUTHORS:        Ivan Petrov ; Daiheng Gao ; Nikolay Chervoniy ; Kunlin Liu ; Sugasa Marangonda ; Chris Umé ; Mr. Dpfks ; Carl Shift Facenheim ; Luis RP ; Jian Jiang ; Sheng Zhang ; Pingyu Wu ; Bo Zhou ; Weiming Zhang
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we detail the principles that drive the implementation of DeepFaceLab and introduce the pipeline of it, through which every aspect of the pipeline can be modified painlessly by users to achieve their customization purpose, and it's noteworthy that DeepFaceLab could achieve results with high fidelity and indeed indiscernible by mainstream forgery detection approaches.

57, TITLE:      Extended 2D Consensus Hippocampus Segmentation
http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04487
AUTHORS:        Diedre Carmo ; Bruna Silva ; Clarissa Yasuda ; Letícia Rittner ; Roberto Lotufo
COMMENTS:       This was published as an extended abstract in MIDL 2019 [arXiv:1907.08612]. An alpha version of the code is available at https://github.com/dscarmo/e2dhipseg. More experiments on improvements to the method and code are ongoing. Future updates are to be expected. A new, more complete paper is published in arXiv:2001.05058
HIGHLIGHT:      A method for volumetric hippocampus segmentation is presented, based on the consensus of tri-planar U-Net inspired fully convolutional networks (FCNNs), with some modifications, including residual connections, VGG weight transfers, batch normalization and a patch extraction technique employing data from neighbor patches.
