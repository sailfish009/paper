4, TITLE: Multilingual LLMs Struggle to Link Orthography and Semantics in Bilingual Word Processing
AUTHORS: Eshaan Tanwar ; Gayatri Oke ; Tanmoy Chakraborty
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]

We investigate how multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) handle such phenomena, focusing on English-Spanish, English-French, and English-German cognates, non-cognate, and interlingual homographs.

139, TITLE: Analyzing Continuous Semantic Shifts with Diachronic Word Similarity Matrices
AUTHORS: HAJIME KIYAMA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: The meanings and relationships of words shift over time. This phenomenon is referred to as semantic shift.Research focused on understanding how semantic shifts occur over multiple time periods is essential for gaining a detailed understanding of semantic shifts.However, detecting change points only between adjacent time periods is insufficient for analyzing detailed semantic shifts, and using BERT-based methods to examine word sense proportions incurs a high computational cost.To address those issues, we propose a simple yet intuitive framework for how semantic shifts occur over multiple time periods by leveraging a similarity matrix between the embeddings of the same word through time.We compute a diachronic word similarity matrix using fast and lightweight word embeddings across arbitrary time periods, making it deeper to analyze continuous semantic shifts.Additionally, by clustering the similarity matrices for different words, we can categorize words that exhibit similar behavior of semantic shift in an unsupervised manner.
