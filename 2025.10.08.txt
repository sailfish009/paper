AUTHORS: Mai AlKhamissi; Yunze Xiao; Badr AlKhamissi; Mona Diab
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Cultural evaluation of large language models has become increasinglyimportant, yet current benchmarks often reduce culture to static facts orhomogeneous values. This view conflicts with anthropological accounts thatemphasize culture as dynamic, historically situated, and enacted in practice.To analyze this gap, we introduce a four-part framework that categorizes howbenchmarks frame culture, such as knowledge, preference, performance, or bias.Using this lens, we qualitatively examine 20 cultural benchmarks and identifysix recurring methodological issues, including treating countries as cultures,overlooking within-culture diversity, and relying on oversimplified surveyformats.

71, TITLE: Deforming Videos to Masks: Flow Matching for Referring Video Segmentation
AUTHORS: Zanyi Wang; Dengyang Jiang; Liuzhuozheng Li; Sizhe Dang; Chengzu Li; Harry Yang; Guang Dai; Mengmeng Wang; Jingdong Wang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, this cascaded design creates aninformation bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmentingprocess is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcomethese fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework thatreconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem.

205, TITLE: Self-Filtered Distillation with LLMs-generated Trust Indicators for Reliable Patent Classification
AUTHORS: Yongmin Yoo; Xu Zhang; Longbing Cao
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Directly using suchrationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining trainingstability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation,a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treatsLLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision.The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trustmetrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generatedrationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, whichassesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLMAgreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility.
