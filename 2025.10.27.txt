In this work, we address these limitations byintroducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which wefine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responsesfrom multiple participants.

HIGHLIGHT: However, current systemsremain fundamentally constrained to textual web data, overlooking the vastknowledge embedded in multimodal documents Processing such documents demandssophisticated parsing to preserve visual semantics (figures, tables, charts,and equations), intelligent chunking to maintain structural coherence, andadaptive retrieval across modalities, which are capabilities absent in existingsystems. In response, we present Doc-Researcher, a unified system that bridgesthis gap through three integrated components: (i) deep multimodal parsing thatpreserves layout structure and visual semantics while creating multi-granularrepresentations from chunk to document level, (ii) systematic retrievalarchitecture supporting text-only, vision-only, and hybrid paradigms withdynamic granularity selection, and (iii) iterative multi-agent workflows thatdecompose complex queries, progressively accumulate evidence, and synthesizecomprehensive answers across documents and modalities.

AUTHORS: Yingzhi Mao; Chunkang Zhang; Junxiang Wang; Xinyan Guan; Boxi Cao; Yaojie Lu; Hongyu Lin; Xianpei Han; Le Sun
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing mitigation strategies relyon injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppressreasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. Tosystematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories ofdiverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where modelsoverride their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafequeries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a trainingframework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering themodel back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarksdemonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs whilepreserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming priormethods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.
