Hence, we propose three novel research directions that focus on uncertainties in such human-computer interactions: Underspecification uncertainties, for when users do not provide all information or define the exact task at the first go, interactive learning, to ask follow-up questions and reduce the uncertainty about the current context, and output uncertainties, to utilize the rich language and speech space to express uncertainties as more than mere numbers.

12, TITLE: VeriTrail: Closed-Domain Hallucination Detection with Traceability
AUTHORS: Dasha Metropolitansky ; Jonathan Larson
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, due to the greater complexity of MGS processes, we argue that detecting hallucinations in their final outputs is necessary but not sufficient: it is equally important to trace where hallucinated content was likely introduced and how faithful content may have been derived from the source through intermediate outputs. To address this need, we present VeriTrail, the first closed-domain hallucination detection method designed to provide traceability for both MGS and SGS processes.

13, TITLE: Precise In-Parameter Concept Erasure in Large Language Models

To address these limitations, we propose a resource-aware multi-agent system -- Co-Saving (meaning that multiple agents collaboratively engage in resource-saving activities), which leverages experiential knowledge to enhance operational efficiency and solution quality.

We can train "atomic CoT" models on the atomic tasks with Composable CoT data and combine them with multitask learning or model merging for better zero-shot performance on the target compositional task.

45, TITLE: Prototype Embedding Optimization for Human-Object Interaction Detection in Livestreaming
AUTHORS: Menghui Zhang ; Jing Zhang ; Lin Chen ; Li Zhuo
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While human-object interaction (HOI) detection has made some progress in general-purpose video downstream tasks, when applied to recognize the interaction behaviors between a streamer and different objects in livestreaming, it tends to focuses too much on the objects and neglects their interactions with the streamer, which leads to object bias. To solve this issue, we propose a prototype embedding optimization for human-object interaction detection (PeO-HOI).

AUTHORS: LAI WEI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While "aha moment" patterns--where models exhibit self-correction through reflection--are often attributed to emergent properties from RL, we first demonstrate that these patterns exist in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) prior to RL training but may not necessarily correlate with improved reasoning performance. Building on these insights, we present a comprehensive study on enhancing multimodal reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start with structured chain-of-thought reasoning patterns, followed by (2) reinforcement learning via GRPO to further refine these capabilities.

CATEGORY: cs.GT [cs.GT, cs.AI, cs.MA]
HIGHLIGHT: In particular, we study personalized $2$-value instances, where there are only two possible values each agent may have for each good, possibly different across agents, and we show how to obtain worst case guarantees with respect to well-known fairness notions, such as maximin share fairness and envy-freeness up to one (or two) good(s). We suggest a deterministic algorithm that maintains a $1/(2n-1)$-MMS allocation at every time step and show that this is the best possible any deterministic algorithm can achieve if one cares about every single time step; nevertheless, eventually the allocation constructed by our algorithm becomes a $1/4$-MMS allocation.

AUTHORS: Jinhong Ni ; Chang-Bin Zhang ; Qiang Zhang ; Jing Zhang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Our analysis reveals the following: 1) the query and key matrices in the attention modules are responsible for common information that can be shared between the panoramic and perspective domains, thus are less relevant to panorama generation; and 2) the value and output weight matrices specialize in adapting pre-trained knowledge to the panoramic domain, playing a more critical role during fine-tuning for panorama generation. We empirically verify these insights by introducing a simple framework called UniPano, with the objective of establishing an elegant baseline for future research.

375, TITLE: Towards Comprehensive Scene Understanding: Integrating First and Third-Person Views for LVLMs
AUTHORS: INSU LEE et. al.
