AUTHORS: Rawad Melhem ; Assef Jafar ; Oumayma Al Dakkak
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: The lack of realistic training sets for speaker separation remains a major hurdle, as obtaining individual sounds from mixed audio signals is a nontrivial task. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for constructing a realistic training set that includes mixture signals and corresponding ground truths for each speaker.
