HIGHLIGHT: However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M).

247, TITLE: Zero-Shot Prompting and Few-Shot Fine-Tuning: Revisiting Document Image Classification Using Large Language Models
AUTHORS: Anna Scius-Bertrand ; Michael Jungo ; Lars V�gtlin ; Jean-Marc Spat ; Andreas Fischer
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), which are excellent few-shot learners, the question arises to what extent the document classification problem can be addressed with only a few training samples, or even none at all. In this paper, we investigate this question in the context of zero-shot prompting and few-shot model fine-tuning, with the aim of reducing the need for human-annotated training samples as much as possible.
