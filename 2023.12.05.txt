319, TITLE: Towards An Accurate and Generalizable Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation Model Using Self-ensembled Lesion Fusion
AUTHORS: JINWEI ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we developed an accurate and generalizable MS lesion segmentation model using the well-known U-Net architecture without further modification.

320, TITLE: MobileUtr: Revisiting The Relationship Between Light-weight CNN and Transformer for Efficient Medical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: FENGHE TANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, I.4.6]
HIGHLIGHT: This work revisits the relationship between CNNs and Transformers in lightweight universal networks for medical image segmentation, aiming to integrate the advantages of both worlds at the infrastructure design level.

321, TITLE: Equivariant Plug-and-play Image Reconstruction
AUTHORS: Matthieu Terris ; Thomas Moreau ; Nelly Pustelnik ; Julian Tachella
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Unfortunately, plug-and-play methods often show unstable behaviors, hampering their promise of versatility and leading to suboptimal quality of reconstructed images. In this work, we show that enforcing equivariance to certain groups of transformations (rotations, reflections, and/or translations) on the denoiser strongly improves the stability of the algorithm as well as its reconstruction quality.

322, TITLE: Motion-aware Needle Segmentation in Ultrasound Images
AUTHORS: RAGHAVV GOEL et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present a novel approach for needle segmentation that combines classical Kalman Filter (KF) techniques with data-driven learning, incorporating both needle features and needle motion.

323, TITLE: TMSR: Tiny Multi-path CNNs for Super Resolution
AUTHORS: Chia-Hung Liu ; Tzu-Hsin Hsieh ; Kuan-Yu Huang ; Pei-Yin Chen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we proposed a tiny multi-path CNN-based Super-Resolution (SR) method, called TMSR.

324, TITLE: Adversarial Medical Image with Hierarchical Feature Hiding
AUTHORS: QINGSONG YAO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: It has been discovered that conventional adversarial attacks like PGD which optimize the classification logits, are easy to distinguish in the feature space, resulting in accurate reactive defenses. To better understand this phenomenon and reassess the reliability of the reactive defenses for medical AEs, we thoroughly investigate the characteristic of conventional medical AEs.

325, TITLE: Fast and Accurate Sparse-view CBCT Reconstruction Using Meta-learned Neural Attenuation Field and Hash-encoding Regularization
AUTHORS: HEEJUN SHIN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a fast and accurate sparse-view CBCT reconstruction (FACT) method to provide better reconstruction quality and faster optimization speed in the minimal number of view acquisitions ($<$ 50 views).

326, TITLE: A Comparative Analysis Towards Melanoma Classification Using Transfer Learning By Analyzing Dermoscopic Images
AUTHORS: Md. Fahim Uddin ; Nafisa Tafshir ; Mohammad Monirujjaman Khan
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Using Convolutional Neural Networks, it presents a method for categorizing melanoma images into benign and malignant images in this research (CNNs).
