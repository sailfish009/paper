AUTHORS: YIWEI CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While current alignment strategies primarily rely on supervised safety fine-tuning with curated datasets, we identify a fundamental limitation we call the "safety mirage" where supervised fine-tuning inadvertently reinforces spurious correlations between superficial textual patterns and safety responses, rather than fostering deep, intrinsic mitigation of harm. We show that these spurious correlations leave fine-tuned VLMs vulnerable even to a simple one-word modification-based attack, where substituting a single word in text queries with a spurious correlation-inducing alternative can effectively bypass safeguards.

To address these limitations, we propose KDSelector, a novel knowledge-enhanced and data-efficient framework for learning the NN-based TSAD model selector, of which three key components are specifically designed to integrate available knowledge into the selector and dynamically prune less important and redundant samples during the learning.

453, TITLE: ICCO: Learning An Instruction-conditioned Coordinator for Language-guided Task-aligned Multi-robot Control
AUTHORS: Yoshiki Yano ; Kazuki Shibata ; Maarten Kokshoorn ; Takamitsu Matsubara
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, achieving effective coordination in distributed multi-agent environments remains challenging due to (1) misalignment between instructions and task requirements and (2) inconsistency in robot behaviors when they independently interpret ambiguous instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Instruction-Conditioned Coordinator (ICCO), a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework designed to enhance coordination in language-guided multi-robot systems.

464, TITLE: From Pixels to Histopathology: A Graph-Based Framework for Interpretable Whole Slide Image Analysis
AUTHORS: ALEXANDER WEERS et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT: While deep learning methods show promising results, they typically process WSIs by dividing them into artificial patches, which inherently prevents a network from learning from the entire image context, disregards natural tissue structures and compromises interpretability. Our method overcomes this limitation through a novel graph-based framework that constructs WSI graph representations.
