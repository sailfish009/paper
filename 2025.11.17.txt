HIGHLIGHT: Prior image imagination based VLN work shows benefits for discrete panoramas but lacks online, action-conditioned predictions and does not produce explicit planning values; moreover, many methods replace the planner with long-horizon objectives that are brittle and slow. To bridge this gap, we propose VISTAv2, a generative world model that rolls out egocentric future views conditioned on past observations, candidate action sequences, and instructions, and projects them into an online value map for planning.

To further reduce the number of trainable parameters, we propose a point-cloud-specific PEFT, termed Graph Features Tuning (GFT), which learns a dynamic graph from initial tokenized inputs of the transformer using a lightweight graph convolution network and passes these graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules.

AUTHORS: Guangke Chen; Yuhui Wang; Shouling Ji; Xiapu Luo; Ting Wang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.SD [SD]

We present HARMGEN, a suite of five attacks organized into two families that address these challenges.

CATEGORY: Buildings [BUILDINGS]
HIGHLIGHT: Conventional approaches to building energy retrofit decision-making struggle to generalize across diverse building characteristics, climate conditions, and occupant behaviors, and often lack interpretability.

To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities.

AUTHORS: Yifan Liu; Fangneng Zhan; Kaichen Zhou; Yilun Du; Paul Pu Liang; Hanspeter Pfister

HIGHLIGHT: We attribute this to a modality gap between the 3D tasks and the 2D training of VLM, which led to inefficient retrieval of 3D information from 2D input. To bridge this gap, we introduce SandboxVLM, a simple yet effective framework that leverages abstract bounding boxes to encode geometric structure and physical kinematics for VLM.

AUTHORS: Ren Zhang; Huilai Li; Chao qi; Guoliang Xu; Tianyu Zhou; Wei wei; Jianqin Yin
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement.

AUTHORS: Feng-Qi Cui; Jinyang Huang; Ziyu Jia; Xinyu Li; Xin Yan; Xiaokang Zhou; Meng Wang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process.

215, TITLE: Enhancing Meme Emotion Understanding with Multi-Level Modality Enhancement and Dual-Stage Modal Fusion
AUTHORS: Yi Shi; Wenlong Meng; Zhenyuan Guo; Chengkun Wei; Wenzhi Chen
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: While existing efforts have achieved promising results, two major challenges remain: (1) a lack of fine-grained multimodal fusion strategies, and (2) insufficient mining of memes' implicit meanings and background knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose MemoDetector, a novel framework for advancing MEU.

To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer).

To address these challenges, this paper introduces coupling gates as components in specific modules to filter noise and perform feature importance selection.

AUTHORS: Chuheng Chen; Xiaofei Zhou; Geyuan Zhang; Yong Huang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions.

242, TITLE: Free3D: 3D Human Motion Emerges from Single-View 2D Supervision
AUTHORS: Sheng Liu; Yuanzhi Liang; Sidan Du
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations.

AUTHORS: Zhongbin Guo; Jiahe Liu; Yushan Li; Wenyu Gao; Zhen Yang; Chenzhi Li; Xinyue Zhang; Ping Jian

HIGHLIGHT: This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation.
