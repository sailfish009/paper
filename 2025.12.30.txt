9, TITLE: Understanding The Mechanisms of Fast Hyperparameter Transfer
AUTHORS: Nikhil Ghosh; Denny Wu; Alberto Bietti
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We show that this property depends critically on problem structure by presenting synthetic settings where transfer either offers provable computational advantage or fails to outperform direct tuning even under $μ$P. To explain the fast transfer observed in practice, we conjecture that decomposing the optimization trajectory reveals two contributions to loss reduction: (1) a width-stable component that determines the optimal HPs, and (2) a width-sensitive component that improves with width but weakly perturbs the HP optimum. We present empirical evidence for this hypothesis across various settings, including large language model pretraining.

AUTHORS: Chunyuan Chen; Yunuo Cai; Shujuan Li; Weiyun Liang; Bin Wang; Jing Xu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing CIG methods still suffer from a substantial gap to real camouflaged imagery: generated images either lack sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or exhibit cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. To address these limitations, we propose ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework for realistic camouflaged image generation.

225, TITLE: Is Chain-of-Thought Really Not Explainability? Chain-of-Thought Can Be Faithful Without Hint Verbalization
AUTHORS: Kerem Zaman; Shashank Srivastava
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent work, using the Biasing Features metric, labels a CoT as unfaithful if it omits a prompt-injected hint that affected the prediction. We argue this metric confuses unfaithfulness with incompleteness, the lossy compression needed to turn distributed transformer computation into a linear natural language narrative.

AUTHORS: Naman Aggarwal; Siddhartha R. Dalal; Vishal Misra
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Across two tasks -- bijection elimination and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) state tracking -- we find that transformers implement Bayesian inference through a consistent geometric mechanism: residual streams serve as the belief substrate, feed-forward networks perform the posterior update, and attention provides content-addressable routing.

230, TITLE: Geometric Scaling of Bayesian Inference in LLMs
AUTHORS: Naman Aggarwal; Siddhartha R. Dalal; Vishal Misra
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent work has shown that small transformers trained in controlled "wind-tunnel'' settings can implement exact Bayesian inference, and that their training dynamics produce a geometric substrate -- low-dimensional value manifolds and progressively orthogonal keys -- that encodes posterior structure. We investigate whether this geometric signature persists in production-grade language models.

231, TITLE: A Reinforcement Learning Guided Oppositional Mountain Gazelle Optimizer for Time–Cost–Risk Trade-Off Optimization Problems
AUTHORS: Mohammad Azim Eirgash; Jun-Jiat Tiang; Bayram Ateş; Abhishek Sharma; Wei Hong Lim

HIGHLIGHT: Existing metaheuristic approaches often struggle to maintain an effective exploration–exploitation balance and are prone to premature convergence when addressing highly conflicting time–cost–safety–risk trade-off problems (TCSRTPs) under complex construction project constraints, which can adversely affect project productivity, safety, and the provision of decent jobs in the construction sector. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a hybrid metaheuristic called the Q-Learning Inspired Mountain Gazelle Optimizer (QL-MGO) for solving multi-objective TCSRTPs in construction project management, supporting the delivery of resilient infrastructure and resilient building projects.

HIGHLIGHT: However, it has been observed that LVLMs, after tuning to visual instruction using commonly used training datasets, often fail to exhibit the instruction-following ability that was present in the LLM before integration, leading to results in which they do not follow task instructions as expected. This study quantitatively demonstrates that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning and analyzes its underlying causes.
