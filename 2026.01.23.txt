AUTHORS: Yunshan Qi; Lin Zhu; Nan Bao; Yifan Zhao; Jia Li
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although existing methods employ event data to address this issue, they ignore the sensor-physics mismatches between the camera output and physical world radiance, resulting in suboptimal HDR and deblurring results. To cope with this problem, we propose a unified sensor-physics grounded NeRF framework for sharp HDR novel view synthesis from single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events.

AUTHORS: Zhiyao Ren; Yibing Zhan; Siyuan Liang; Guozheng Ma; Baosheng Yu; Dacheng Tao
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We implement and compare 27 representative methods on this benchmark; two key insights emerge: (1) medical data amplifies the inherent limitations of token-level and consistency-level confidence methods, and (2) medical reasoning must be evaluated for both diagnostic accuracy and information completeness. Based on these insights, we present MedConf, an evidence-grounded linguistic self-assessment framework that constructs symptom profiles via retrieval-augmented generation, aligns patient information with supporting, missing, and contradictory relations, and aggregates them into an interpretable confidence estimate through weighted integration.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: It conditions its action predictions on Return-to-Go (RTG), using it both to distinguish trajectory quality during training and to guide action generation at inference. In this work, we identify a critical redundancy in this design: feeding the entire sequence of RTGs into the Transformer is theoretically unnecessary, as only the most recent RTG affects action prediction.

AUTHORS: Zhiwei Zhang; Fei Zhao; Rui Wang; Zezhong Wang; Bin Liang; Jiakang Wang; Yao Hu; Shaosheng Cao; Kam-Fai Wong
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We identify a key limitation of current approaches: standard reinforcement learning (RL) treats errors as sparse negative rewards, providing no guidance on how to recover, while pre-collected synthetic error-correction datasets suffer from distribution mismatch with the model's on-policy error modes. To bridge this gap, we propose Fission-GRPO, a framework that converts execution errors into corrective supervision within the RL training loop.

AUTHORS: Shihao Zheng; Yong Li; Xiang Ma
CATEGORY: Applied Sciences [APPLIED SCIENCES]
HIGHLIGHT: While code pre-trained models (CodePTMs) offer a robust foundation for general-purpose embeddings, current PEFT approaches face two main obstacles when adapting them: (i) they fail to adequately capture the deep structural characteristics of programs, and (ii) they are limited by the model’s finite internal parameters, restricting their ability to overcome inherent knowledge bottlenecks. To address these challenges, we introduce a parameter-efficient code representation learning framework that combines retrieval augmentation with structure-aware priors.

HIGHLIGHT: Drawing inspiration from recent findings including surprisingly decent performance of transformers without positional encoding (NoPE) in the domain of language models and how registers (additional throwaway tokens not tied to input) may improve the performance of large vision transformers (ViTs), we invent and test a variant of ViT called fractal ViT that breaks permutation invariance among the tokens by applying an attention mask between the regular tokens and ``summary tokens'' similar to registers, in isolation or in combination with various positional encodings. These models do not improve upon ViT with registers, highlighting the fact that these findings may be scale, domain, or application-specific.
