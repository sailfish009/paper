88, TITLE: Long-Tailed Out-of-Distribution Detection Via Normalized Outlier Distribution Adaptation
AUTHORS: Wenjun Miao ; Guansong Pang ; Jin Zheng ; Xiao Bai

In this work, we propose a novel approach, namely normalized outlier distribution adaptation (AdaptOD), to tackle this distribution shift problem.

319, TITLE: Self-Normalized Resets for Plasticity in Continual Learning
AUTHORS: Vivek F. Farias ; Adam D. Jozefiak
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Plasticity Loss is an increasingly important phenomenon that refers to the empirical observation that as a neural network is continually trained on a sequence of changing tasks, its ability to adapt to a new task diminishes over time. We introduce Self-Normalized Resets (SNR), a simple adaptive algorithm that mitigates plasticity loss by resetting a neuron's weights when evidence suggests its firing rate has effectively dropped to zero.
