73, TITLE: RSAgent: Learning to Reason and Act for Text-Guided Segmentation Via Multi-Turn Tool Invocations
AUTHORS: Xingqi He; Yujie Zhang; Shuyong Gao; Wenjie Li; Lingyi Hong; Mingxi Chen; Kaixun Jiang; Jiyuan Fu; Wenqiang Zhang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations.

78, TITLE: RANGER: A Monocular Zero-Shot Semantic Navigation Framework Through Contextual Adaptation
AUTHORS: Ming-Ming Yu; Yi Chen; Börje F. Karlsson; Wenjun Wu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.RO [RO]
HIGHLIGHT: While recent advances in multimodal foundation models have enabled zero-shot object goal navigation, allowing robots to search for arbitrary objects without fine-tuning, existing methods face two key limitations: (1) heavy reliance on precise depth and pose information provided by simulators, which restricts applicability in real-world scenarios; and (2) lack of in-context learning (ICL) capability, making it difficult to quickly adapt to new environments, as in leveraging short videos. To address these challenges, we propose RANGER, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic navigation framework that operates using only a monocular camera.

To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed.

118, TITLE: GCA-ResUNet: Medical Image Segmentation Using Grouped Coordinate Attention

AUTHORS: Lijun Zhang; Lin Li; Wei Wei; Yajie Qi; Huizhong Song; Jun Wang; Yaodong Yang; Jiye Liang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]

To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based navigation framework, DRL-TH, which leverages temporal graph attention and hierarchical graph pooling to integrate historical observations and adaptively fuse multi-modal information.
