98, TITLE: Covering All The Bases: Type-based Verification of Test Input Generators
AUTHORS: Zhe Zhou ; Ashish Mishra ; Benjamin Delaware ; Suresh Jagannathan
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: Typically, developers must rely on manual inspection and post-mortem analysis of test runs to determine if the generator is providing sufficient coverage; these approaches are error-prone and difficult to scale as generators become more complex. To address this important concern, we present a new refinement type-based verification procedure for validating the coverage provided by input test generators, based on a novel interpretation of types that embeds ``must-style'' underapproximate reasoning principles as a fundamental part of the type system.

In this work we study the problem of consistency checking for popular variants of the C11 memory model, in particular, the RC20 model, its release-acquire (RA) fragment, the strong and weak variants of RA (SRA and WRA), as well as the Relaxed fragment of RC20.
