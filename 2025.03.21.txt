89, TITLE: LLM Braces: Straightening Out LLM Predictions with Relevant Sub-Updates
AUTHORS: Ying Shen ; Lifu Huang
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent findings reveal that much of the knowledge in a Transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) is encoded in its feed-forward (FFN) layers, where each FNN layer can be interpreted as the summation of sub-updates, each corresponding to a weighted column vector from the FFN's value parameter matrix that often encodes human-interpretable concepts. In light of this, we hypothesize that model performance and behaviors can be further enhanced and controlled by modulating the contributions of these sub-updates based on their relevance to the input or target output style, and propose LLMBRACES, a novel and efficient method that computes relevance scores associated with value vectors in FFN layers and leverages these scores to dynamically adjust the contribution of sub-updates.

AUTHORS: JIALE WEI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.IR]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions.

228, TITLE: Coupling Deep and Handcrafted Features to Assess Smile Genuineness
AUTHORS: Benedykt Pawlus ; Bogdan Smolka ; Jolanta Kawulok ; Michal Kawulok
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: There have been a number of techniques proposed underpinned with handcrafted features, as well as those that rely on deep learning to elaborate the useful features. As both of these approaches have certain benefits and limitations, in this work we propose to combine the features learned by a long short-term memory network with the features handcrafted to capture the dynamics of facial action units.

229, TITLE: SPNeRF: Open Vocabulary 3D Neural Scene Segmentation with Superpoints
AUTHORS: WEIWEN HU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Extending these capabilities to 3D segmentation introduces challenges, as CLIP's image-based embeddings often lack the geometric detail necessary for 3D scene segmentation. Recent methods tend to address this by introducing additional segmentation models or replacing CLIP with variations trained on segmentation data, which lead to redundancy or loss on CLIP's general language capabilities.

231, TITLE: Beyond The Visible: Multispectral Vision-Language Learning for Earth Observation
AUTHORS: Clive Tinashe Marimo ; Benedikt Blumenstiel ; Maximilian Nitsche ; Johannes Jakubik ; Thomas Brunschwiler
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Vision-language models for Earth observation (EO) typically rely on the visual spectrum of data as the only model input, thus failing to leverage the rich spectral information available in the multispectral channels recorded by satellites. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Llama3-MS-CLIP, the first vision-language model pre-trained with contrastive learning on a large-scale multispectral dataset and report on the performance gains due to the extended spectral range.

233, TITLE: RL4Med-DDPO: Reinforcement Learning for Controlled Guidance Towards Diverse Medical Image Generation Using Vision-Language Foundation Models
AUTHORS: Parham Saremi ; Amar Kumar ; Mohammed Mohammed ; Zahra TehraniNasab ; Tal Arbel
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While VLFMs show a rich understanding of semantic content across modalities, they often struggle with fine-grained alignment tasks that require precise correspondence between image regions and textual descriptions a limitation in medical imaging, where accurate localization and detection of clinical features are essential for diagnosis and analysis. To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage architecture where a pre-trained VLFM provides a cursory semantic understanding, while a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm refines the alignment through an iterative process that optimizes for understanding semantic context.

To address this issue, we propose Zero-1-to-A, a robust method that synthesizes a spatial and temporal consistency dataset for 4D avatar reconstruction using the video diffusion model.
