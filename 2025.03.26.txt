34, TITLE: FUSE: Label-Free Image-Event Joint Monocular Depth Estimation Via Frequency-Decoupled Alignment and Degradation-Robust Fusion
AUTHORS: PIHAI SUN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Image-event joint depth estimation methods leverage complementary modalities for robust perception, yet face challenges in generalizability stemming from two factors: 1) limited annotated image-event-depth datasets causing insufficient cross-modal supervision, and 2) inherent frequency mismatches between static images and dynamic event streams with distinct spatiotemporal patterns, leading to ineffective feature fusion. To address this dual challenge, we propose Frequency-decoupled Unified Self-supervised Encoder (FUSE) with two synergistic components: The Parameter-efficient Self-supervised Transfer (PST) establishes cross-modal knowledge transfer through latent space alignment with image foundation models, effectively mitigating data scarcity by enabling joint encoding without depth ground truth.Complementing this, we propose the Frequency-Decoupled Fusion module (FreDFuse) to explicitly decouple high-frequency edge features from low-frequency structural components, resolving modality-specific frequency mismatches through physics-aware fusion.

HIGHLIGHT: However, the insufficient number of extracted semantic features of images will potentially result in a low reconstruction accuracy, which hinders the practical applications and still remains challenging for solving. In order to fill this gap, this letter proposes a multi-text transmission semantic communication (Multi-SC) system, which uses the visual language model (VLM) to assist in the transmission of image semantic signals.
