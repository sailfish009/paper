AUTHORS: Adrian Galdran ; Miguel A. Gonz�lez Ballester
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This so-called data-centric approach can lead to substantial performance increases, sometimes beyond what can be achieved by larger models. In this paper we adopt such an approach for the task of justifiable glaucoma screening from retinal images.

234, TITLE: Polyp and Surgical Instrument Segmentation with Double Encoder-Decoder Networks
AUTHORS: Adrian Galdran
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper describes a solution for the MedAI competition, in which participants were required to segment both polyps and surgical instruments from endoscopic images.

235, TITLE: LDM-RSIC: Exploring Distortion Prior with Latent Diffusion Models for Remote Sensing Image Compression
AUTHORS: JUNHUI LI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a latent diffusion model-based remote sensing image compression (LDM-RSIC) method, which aims to enhance the final decoding quality of RS images by utilizing the generated distortion prior from a LDM.
