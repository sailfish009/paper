AUTHORS: Yifan Yang; Zhi Cen; Sida Peng; Xiangwei Chen; Yifu Deng; Xinyu Zhu; Fan Jia; Xiaowei Zhou; Hujun Bao
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper focuses on the task of speech-driven 3D facial animation, which aims to generate realistic and synchronized facial motions driven by speech inputs.Recent methods have employed audio-conditioned diffusion models for 3D facial animation, achieving impressive results in generating expressive and natural animations.However, these methods process the whole audio sequences in a single pass, which poses two major challenges: they tend to perform poorly when handling audio sequences that exceed the training horizon and will suffer from significant latency when processing long audio inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning.

HIGHLIGHT: However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM).

198, TITLE: Gaussian Splatting-based Low-Rank Tensor Representation for Multi-Dimensional Image Recovery
AUTHORS: Yiming Zeng; Xi-Le Zhao; Wei-Hao Wu; Teng-Yu Ji; Chao Wang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images.

202, TITLE: Hardness of Range Avoidance and Proof Complexity Generators from Demi-Bits
AUTHORS: Hanlin Ren; Yichuan Wang; Yan Zhong
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CC [CC]
HIGHLIGHT: Besides its profound connection to circuit complexity and explicit construction problems, this problem is also related to the existence of *proof complexity generators* -- circuits $G: \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^m$ where $m > n$ but for every $y\in \{0, 1\}^m$, it is infeasible to prove the statement "$y\not\in\mathrm{Range}(G)$" in a given propositional proof system.

265, TITLE: RSPose: Ranking Based Losses for Human Pose Estimation
AUTHORS: Muhammed Can Keles; Bedrettin Cetinkaya; Sinan Kalkan; Emre Akbas
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While heatmap-based human pose estimation methods have shown strong performance, they suffer from three main problems: (P1) "Commonly used Mean Squared Error (MSE)" Loss may not always improve joint localization because it penalizes all pixel deviations equally, without focusing explicitly on sharpening and correctly localizing the peak corresponding to the joint; (P2) heatmaps are spatially and class-wise imbalanced; and, (P3) there is a discrepancy between the evaluation metric (i.e., mAP) and the loss functions. We propose ranking-based losses to address these issues.

277, TITLE: Quantifying and Mitigating Selection Bias in LLMs: A Transferable LoRA Fine-Tuning and Efficient Majority Voting Approach
AUTHORS: Blessed Guda; Lawrence Francis; Gabrial Zencha Ashungafac; Carlee Joe-Wong; Moise Busogi
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing selection bias mitigation strategies have notable limitations: majority voting, though effective, is computationally prohibitive; calibration-based methods require validation sets and often fail to generalize across datasets. To address these gaps, we propose three key contributions: (1) a new unsupervised label-free Permutation Bias Metric (PBM) that directly quantifies inconsistencies in model predictions across answer permutations, providing a more precise measure of selection bias, (2) an efficient majority voting approach called Batch Question-Context KV caching (BaQCKV), to significantly reduce computational costs while preserving bias mitigation effectiveness, and (3) an unsupervised Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA-1) fine-tuning strategy based on our proposed metric and the BaQCKV that mitigates selection bias, providing a computationally efficient alternative that maintains model generalizability.

280, TITLE: Rethinking The Encoding and Annotating of 3D Bounding Box: Corner-Aware 3D Object Detection from Point Clouds
AUTHORS: Qinghao Meng; Junbo Yin; Jianbing Shen; Yunde Jia
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Center-aligned regression remains dominant in LiDAR-based 3D object detection, yet it suffers from fundamental instability: object centers often fall in sparse or empty regions of the bird's-eye-view (BEV) due to the front-surface-biased nature of LiDAR point clouds, leading to noisy and inaccurate bounding box predictions. To circumvent this limitation, we revisit bounding box representation and propose corner-aligned regression, which shifts the prediction target from unstable centers to geometrically informative corners that reside in dense, observable regions.

281, TITLE: Attention Via Synaptic Plasticity Is All You Need: A Biologically Inspired Spiking Neuromorphic Transformer

To address these issues, we propose the Spiking STDP Transformer (S$^{2}$TDPT), a neuromorphic Transformer that implements self-attention through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), embedding query--key correlations in synaptic weights.

AUTHORS: Mikael von Strauss
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Under real-analytic assumptions on decoder-only Transformers, recent work shows that the map from discrete prompts to last-token hidden states is generically injective on finite prompt sets. We refine this picture: for each layer $\ell$ we define a collision discriminant $Δ^\ell \subset Θ$ and injective stratum $U^\ell = Θ\setminus Δ^\ell$, and prove a dichotomy -- either the model is nowhere injective on the set, or $U^\ell$ is open and dense and every $F^\ell_θ$ is injective.
