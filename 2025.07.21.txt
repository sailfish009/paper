AUTHORS: Debao Huang ; Rongjun Qin
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While uncertainty estimation in the SfMstage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of thereprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved andnon-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modalnature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry).

AUTHORS: SEYYED SAEID CHESHMI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Machine learning approaches have been proposed for HAR tasks usingInertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data; however, most rely onapplication-specific labels and lack generalizability to data collected indifferent environments or populations. To address this limitation, we propose anew cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach to learn representationsfrom large-sale unlabeled IMU-video data and demonstrate improvedgeneralizability in HAR tasks on out of distribution (OOD) IMU datasets,including a dataset collected from patients with Parkinson's disease.Specifically, our results indicate that the proposed cross-modal pretrainingapproach outperforms the current state-of-the-art IMU-video pretrainingapproach and IMU-only pretraining under zero-shot and few-shot evaluations.Broadly, our study provides evidence that in highly dynamic data modalities,such as IMU signals, cross-modal pretraining may be a useful tool to learngeneralizable data representations.
