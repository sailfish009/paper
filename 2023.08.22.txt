HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a cross-modality attention-based multimodal fusion pipeline designed to integrate modality-specific knowledge for patient survival prediction in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

322, TITLE: Polymerized Feature-based Domain Adaptation for Cervical Cancer Dose Map Prediction
AUTHORS: JIE ZENG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, most DL-based dose map prediction methods are data-driven and not applicable for cervical cancer where only a small amount of data is available. To address this problem, this paper proposes to transfer the rich knowledge learned from another cancer, i.e., rectum cancer, which has the same scanning area and more clinically available data, to improve the dose map prediction performance for cervical cancer through domain adaptation.

323, TITLE: Enhancing Medical Image Segmentation: Optimizing Cross-Entropy Weights and Post-Processing with Autoencoders
AUTHORS: PRANAV SINGH et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present a deep-learning approach tailored for Medical image segmentation.

324, TITLE: Prediction of Pneumonia and COVID-19 Using Deep Neural Networks
AUTHORS: M. S. HAQUE et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose machine-learning techniques for predicting Pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

325, TITLE: Developing A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool for Uterine Tumor Imaging
AUTHORS: DARRYL E. WRIGHT et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT: To automate segmentation, we applied nnU-Net and explored the effect of training set size on performance by randomly generating subsets with 25, 45, 65 and 85 training set images.

326, TITLE: Extraction of Text from Optic Nerve Optical Coherence Tomography Reports
AUTHORS: Iyad Majid ; Youchen Victor Zhang ; Robert Chang ; Sophia Y. Wang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate rule-based algorithms to enhance the extraction of text data, including retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) values and other ganglion cell count (GCC) data, from Zeiss Cirrus optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan reports.

327, TITLE: Learning Weakly Convex Regularizers for Convergent Image-Reconstruction Algorithms
AUTHORS: Alexis Goujon ; Sebastian Neumayer ; Michael Unser
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, 26B25, 47A52, 49N45, 68U10, 65D07, 68T05, 90C26]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose to learn non-convex regularizers with a prescribed upper bound on their weak-convexity modulus.

328, TITLE: Contrastive Diffusion Model with Auxiliary Guidance for Coarse-to-Fine PET Reconstruction
AUTHORS: ZEYU HAN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite this, DPMs suffer from two major drawbacks in real clinical settings, i.e., the computationally expensive sampling process and the insufficient preservation of correspondence between the conditioning LPET image and the reconstructed PET (RPET) image. To address the above limitations, this paper presents a coarse-to-fine PET reconstruction framework that consists of a coarse prediction module (CPM) and an iterative refinement module (IRM).

329, TITLE: EDDense-Net: Fully Dense Encoder Decoder Network for Joint Segmentation of Optic Cup and Disc
AUTHORS: Mehwish Mehmood ; Khuram Naveed ; Haroon Ahmed Khan ; Syed S. Naqvi
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present the EDDense-Net segmentation network for the joint segmentation of OC and OD.

330, TITLE: Dual Branch Deep Learning Network for Detection and Stage Grading of Diabetic Retinopathy
AUTHORS: Hossein Shakibania ; Sina Raoufi ; Behnam Pourafkham ; Hassan Khotanlou ; Muharram Mansoorizadeh
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces a deep learning method for the detection and stage grading of diabetic retinopathy, using a single fundus retinal image.
