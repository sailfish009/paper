HIGHLIGHT: Large Language Models (LLMs) are accelerating scientific idea generation, butrigorously evaluating these numerous, often superficial, AI-generatedpropositions for novelty and factual accuracy is a critical bottleneck; manualverification is too slow.Existing validation methods are inadequate: LLMs asstandalone verifiers may hallucinate and lack domain knowledge (our findingsshow ~60\% unawareness of relevant papers in specific domains), whiletraditional citation networks lack explicit causality and narrative surveys areunstructured.This underscores a core challenge: the absence of structured,verifiable, and causally-linked historical data of scientific evolution.Toaddress this,we introduce \textbf{THE-Tree} (\textbf{T}echnology\textbf{H}istory \textbf{E}volution Tree), a computational framework thatconstructs such domain-specific evolution trees from scientificliterature.THE-Tree employs a search algorithm to explore evolutionary paths.During its node expansion, it utilizes a novel "Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify"process: an LLM proposes potential advancements and cites supportingliterature.
