HIGHLIGHT: This research proposes a novel neuromorphic approach that builds upon Leaky Integrate and Fire neuron (LIF) controllers to adjust the magnitude of DBS electric signals according to the various severities of PD patients.

158, TITLE: Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithms for Feature Subset Selection: A Comprehensive Survey
AUTHORS: Yelleti Vivek ; Vadlamani Ravi ; P. Radha Krishna
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, 68W50, 90C27, I.2]
HIGHLIGHT: Importantly, we provided a detailed analysis of the different types of objective functions and popular quantum gates, i.e., rotation gates, employed throughout the literature.

159, TITLE: Overcoming Binary Adversarial Optimisation with Competitive Coevolution
AUTHORS: Per Kristian Lehre ; Shishen Lin
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Through runtime analysis, we aim to rigorously analyse whether CoEAs can efficiently solve test-based adversarial optimisation problems in an expected polynomial runtime.

160, TITLE: Compilation of Commit Changes Within Java Source Code Repositories
AUTHORS: Stefan Schott ; Wolfram Fischer ; Serena Elisa Ponta ; Jonas Klauke ; Eric Bodden
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: But fixcommits are in source code, and automatically compiling whole Java projects to bytecode is notoriously hard, particularly for non-current versions of the code. In this paper, we thus propose JESS, an approach that largely avoids this problem by compiling solely the relevant code that was modified within a given commit.

161, TITLE: I Can Listen But Cannot Read: An Evaluation of Two-tower Multimodal Systems for Instrument Recognition
AUTHORS: Yannis Vasilakis ; Rachel Bittner ; Johan Pauwels
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, cs.IR, cs.LG, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: We present an evaluation and analysis of two-tower systems for zero-shot instrument recognition and a detailed analysis of the properties of the pre-joint and joint embeddings spaces.

162, TITLE: Innovative Speech-Based Deep Learning Approaches for Parkinson's Disease Classification: A Systematic Review
AUTHORS: Lisanne van Gelderen ; Cristian Tejedor-Garc�a
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: This review covers the latest DL-based AI approaches for speech-based PD classification, focusing on performance, available resources and associated challenges of 33 scientific works published between 2020 and March 2024.

163, TITLE: Analyzing Brain Tumor Connectomics Using Graphs and Persistent Homology
AUTHORS: Debanjali Bhattacharya ; Ninad Aithal ; Manish Jayswal ; Neelam Sinha
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.CV, math.AT]
HIGHLIGHT: The present study performs whole-brain connectome analysis using diffusionweighted images.

164, TITLE: Financial Statement Analysis with Large Language Models
AUTHORS: Alex Kim ; Maximilian Muhn ; Valeri Nikolaev
CATEGORY: q-fin.ST [q-fin.ST, cs.AI, cs.CL, q-fin.GN, q-fin.PM]
HIGHLIGHT: We investigate whether an LLM can successfully perform financial statement analysis in a way similar to a professional human analyst.

165, TITLE: HF-Fed: Hierarchical Based Customized Federated Learning Framework for X-Ray Imaging
AUTHORS: Tajamul Ashraf ; Tisha Madame
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have shown promise in X-ray reconstruction, but conventional DL methods often require centralized aggregation of large datasets, leading to domain shifts and privacy issues. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hierarchical Framework-based Federated Learning method (HF-Fed) for customized X-ray imaging.
