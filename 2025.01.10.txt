158, TITLE: UAV-VLA: Vision-Language-Action System for Large Scale Aerial Mission Generation
AUTHORS: OLEG SAUTENKOV et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: The newly developed method showed the difference in the length of the created trajectory in 22% and the mean error in finding the objects of interest on a map in 34.22 m by Euclidean distance in the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach.

159, TITLE: CuRLA: Curriculum Learning Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving
AUTHORS: Bhargava Uppuluri ; Anjel Patel ; Neil Mehta ; Sridhar Kamath ; Pratyush Chakraborty
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Additionally, DRL models lack transparency, making it difficult to guarantee safety in all scenarios, particularly those not seen during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a method that combines DRL with Curriculum Learning for autonomous driving.

160, TITLE: Planing It By Ear: Convolutional Neural Networks for Acoustic Anomaly Detection in Industrial Wood Planers
AUTHORS: ANTHONY DESCH�NES et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: As a step towards the automation of wood-processing equipment and decision support systems for machine operators, in this paper, we explore using a deep convolutional autoencoder for acoustic anomaly detection of wood planers on a new real-life dataset.

AUTHORS: Andrei Iantsen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This work presents an approach to automated delineation of head and neck tumors on MRI scans, developed in the context of the MICCAI Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation for MR-Guided Applications (HNTS-MRG) 2024 Challenge.

163, TITLE: A Steerable Deep Network for Model-Free Diffusion MRI Registration
AUTHORS: Gianfranco Cortes ; Baba C. Vemuri
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a novel, deep learning framework for model-free, nonrigid registration of raw diffusion MRI data that does not require explicit reorientation.

164, TITLE: Optimized Sampling for Non-Line-of-Sight Imaging Using Modified Fast Fourier Transforms
AUTHORS: TALHA SULTAN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.optics]
HIGHLIGHT: All algorithms introduced in this paper preserve the computational complexity of FFT-based methods, ensuring scalability for practical NLOS imaging applications.
