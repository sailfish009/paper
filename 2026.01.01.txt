1, TITLE: Iterative Deployment Improves Planning Skills in LLMs
AUTHORS: AUGUSTO B. CORR�A et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models.
