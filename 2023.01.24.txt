AUTHORS: Nikolos Gurney ; David Pynadath ; Ning Wang

Our analyses suggest the need for augmentation of models so that they account for such biased perceptions as well as mechanisms so that agents can detect and even actively work to correct this and similar biases of users.

In this paper, we introduce a novel and more generic backdoor defense framework, called BayBFed, which proposes to utilize probability distributions over client updates to detect malicious updates in FL: it computes a probabilistic measure over the clients' updates to keep track of any adjustments made in the updates, and uses a novel detection algorithm that can leverage this probabilistic measure to efficiently detect and filter out malicious updates.

82, TITLE: Unifying Synergies Between Self-supervised Learning and Dynamic Computation
AUTHORS: TARUN KRISHNA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Techniques like knowledge distillation (KD), dynamic computation (DC), and pruning are often used to obtain a lightweight sub-network, which usually involves multiple epochs of fine-tuning of a large pre-trained model, making it more computationally challenging. In this work we propose a novel perspective on the interplay between SSL and DC paradigms that can be leveraged to simultaneously learn a dense and gated (sparse/lightweight) sub-network from scratch offering a good accuracy-efficiency trade-off, and therefore yielding a generic and multi-purpose architecture for application specific industrial settings.

86, TITLE: RF+clust for Leave-One-Problem-Out Performance Prediction
AUTHORS: Ana Nikolikj ; Carola Doerr ; Tome Eftimov
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Non-surprisingly, common machine learning models fail to make predictions for instances whose feature-based representation is underrepresented or not covered in the training data, resulting in poor generalization ability of the models for problems not seen during training.In this work, we study leave-one-problem-out (LOPO) performance prediction. We analyze whether standard random forest (RF) model predictions can be improved by calibrating them with a weighted average of performance values obtained by the algorithm on problem instances that are sufficiently close to the problem for which a performance prediction is sought, measured by cosine similarity in feature space.
