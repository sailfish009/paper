320, TITLE: Data-Centric Strategies for Overcoming PET/CT Heterogeneity: Insights from The AutoPET III Lesion Segmentation Challenge
AUTHORS: BALINT KOVACS et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In response, we developed targeted methods to enhance segmentation performance tailored to the characteristics of PET/CT imaging.

321, TITLE: MANGO: Disentangled Image Transformation Manifolds with Grouped Operators
AUTHORS: BRIGHTON ANCELIN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, I.2.6; I.4.2; I.4.7; I.4.10; I.5.1]
HIGHLIGHT: However, this approach has limitations, as the learned operators are not guaranteed to be disentangled and the training routine is prohibitively expensive when scaling up the model. To address these limitations, we propose MANGO (transformation Manifolds with Grouped Operators) for learning disentangled operators that describe image transformations in distinct latent subspaces.

322, TITLE: Real-Time Stochastic Terrain Mapping and Processing for Autonomous Safe Landing
AUTHORS: Kento Tomita ; Koki Ho
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce a Gaussian digital elevation map that is efficiently constructed using the combination of Delauney triangulation and local Gaussian process regression.

323, TITLE: FGR-Net:Interpretable Fundus Imagegradeability Classification Based on Deepreconstruction Learning
AUTHORS: SAIF KHALID et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Consequently, this paper presents a novel framework called FGR-Net to automatically assess and interpret underlying fundus image quality by merging an autoencoder network with a classifier network.

324, TITLE: Reliable Multi-View Learning with Conformal Prediction for Aortic Stenosis Classification in Echocardiography
AUTHORS: Ang Nan Gu ; Michael Tsang ; Hooman Vaseli ; Teresa Tsang ; Purang Abolmaesumi
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose Re-Training for Uncertainty (RT4U), a data-centric method to introduce uncertainty to weakly informative inputs in the training set.

325, TITLE: Cross-modality Image Synthesis from TOF-MRA to CTA Using Diffusion-based Models
AUTHORS: ALEXANDER KOCH et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This study explores diffusion-based image-to-image translation models to generate synthetic CTA images from TOF-MRA input.

326, TITLE: Geometric Clustering for Hardware-Efficient Implementation of Chromatic Dispersion Compensation
AUTHORS: Geraldo Gomes ; Pedro Freire ; Jaroslaw E. Prilepsky ; Sergei K. Turitsyn
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While various strategies for complexity reduction have been proposed, many lack the necessary hardware implementation to validate their benefits. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the tap overlapping effect in CDC filters for coherent receivers, introduces a novel Time-Domain Clustered Equalizer (TDCE) technique based on this concept, and presents a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation for validation.
