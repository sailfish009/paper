1, TITLE: AHELM: A Holistic Evaluation of Audio-Language Models
AUTHORS: TONY LEE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that takeinterleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lackof standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or twocapabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations testa limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inferenceparameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark thataggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasetscalled PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, andCoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio throughinferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure theperformance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to thedevelopment and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotiondetection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metricsto ensure equitable comparisons across models.

154, TITLE: A Mixture of Experts Gating Network for Enhanced Surrogate Modeling in External Aerodynamics
AUTHORS: Mohammad Amin Nabian ; Sanjay Choudhry
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NA, math.NA, physics.flu-dyn]
HIGHLIGHT: WhileML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerateaerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidlyevolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no singlemodel demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novelmeta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as astrength.

AUTHORS: PABLO MORAES et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This simplified andcost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison ofmachine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiringonline training.

AUTHORS: Tobias Lindenbauer ; Igor Slinko ; Ludwig Felder ; Egor Bogomolov ; Yaroslav Zharov
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We find that a simpleobservation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent whilematching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLMsummarization.

AUTHORS: WUQUE CAI et. al.
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.AI, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: The dendrites in biological neuronshave efficient information processing ability and computational power; however,the neurons of SNNs rarely match the complex structure of the dendrites.Inspired by the nonlinear structure and highly sparse properties of neuronaldendrites, in this study, we propose an efficient, lightweight SNN method withnonlinear pruning and dendritic integration (NSPDI-SNN).

AUTHORS: Subham Kutum ; Abhijit Sinha ; Hemant Kumar Kathania ; Sudarsana Reddy Kadiri ; Mahesh Chandra Govil
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.HC, cs.SD, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: Numerous methods have been proposed to enhance Keyword Spotting (KWS) inadult speech, but children's speech presents unique challenges for KWS systemsdue to its distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics. This paperintroduces a zero-shot KWS approach that leverages state-of-the-artself-supervised learning (SSL) models, including Wav2Vec2, HuBERT and Data2Vec.Features are extracted layer-wise from these SSL models and used to train aKaldi-based DNN KWS system.

AUTHORS: ROY M. GABRIEL et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To reduce the amount of required labeled data for lung disease severityclassification from chest X-rays (CXRs) under class imbalance, this studyapplied deep active learning with a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) approximationand weighted loss function. This retrospective study collected 2,319 CXRs from963 patients (mean age, 59.2 $\pm$ 16.6 years; 481 female) at Emory Healthcareaffiliated hospitals between January and November 2020.
