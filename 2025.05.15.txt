HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we describe our journey in developing a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically for the purpose of explaining VHDL code, a task that has particular importance in an organization with decades of experience and assets in high-performance processor design.

154, TITLE: Variational Prefix Tuning for Diverse and Accurate Code Summarization Using Pre-trained Language Models
AUTHORS: Junda Zhao ; Yuliang Song ; Eldan Cohen
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.LG, D.2.7]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we introduce Variational Prefix Tuning (VPT), a novel approach that enhances pre-trained models' ability to generate diverse yet accurate sets of summaries, allowing the user to choose the most suitable one for the given source code.

155, TITLE: Some Computational Tools for Solving A Selection of Problems in Control Theory
AUTHORS: Alexander Demin ; Christina Katsamaki ; Fabrice Rouillier
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC, cs.MS, cs.SY, eess.SY]
HIGHLIGHT: In particular, we introduce PACE.jl, a Julia package that implements symbolic elimination techniques, including (among others) discriminant varieties and Rational Univariate Representation, while also supporting multi-precision interval computations.

156, TITLE: When Repeats Drive The Vocabulary: A Byte-Pair Encoding Analysis of T2T Primate Genomes
AUTHORS: Marina Popova ; Iaroslav Chelombitko ; Aleksey Komissarov
CATEGORY: q-bio.GN [q-bio.GN, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: The emergence of telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assemblies has opened new avenues for comparative genomics, yet effective tokenization strategies for genomic sequences remain underexplored. In this pilot study, we apply Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to nine T2T primate genomes including three human assemblies by training independent BPE tokenizers with a fixed vocabulary of 512,000 tokens using our custom tool, dnaBPE.

157, TITLE: DCSNet: A Lightweight Knowledge Distillation-Based Model with Explainable AI for Lung Cancer Diagnosis from Histopathological Images
AUTHORS: Sadman Sakib Alif ; Nasim Anzum Promise ; Fiaz Al Abid ; Aniqua Nusrat Zereen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a knowledge distillation-based approach for lung cancer detection, incorporating explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance model transparency.

158, TITLE: Meta-learning Slice-to-Volume Reconstruction in Fetal Brain MRI Using Implicit Neural Representations
AUTHORS: MAIK DANNECKER et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a novel SVR method to enable fast and accurate MRI reconstruction even in cases of severe image and motion corruption.
