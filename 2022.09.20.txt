3, TITLE: Dual-Geometric Space Embedding Model for Two-View Knowledge Graphs
AUTHORS: Roshni G. Iyer ; Yunsheng Bai ; Wei Wang ; Yizhou Sun
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.DB, cs.IR]
HIGHLIGHT: For works that seek to put both views of the KG together, the instance and ontology views are assumed to belong to the same geometric space, such as all nodes embedded in the same Euclidean space or non-Euclidean product space, an assumption no longer reasonable for two-view KGs where different portions of the graph exhibit different structures. To address this issue, we define and construct a dual-geometric space embedding model (DGS) that models two-view KGs using a complex non-Euclidean geometric space, by embedding different portions of the KG in different geometric spaces.

18, TITLE: Selective Token Generation for Few-shot Natural Language Generation
AUTHORS: Daejin Jo ; Taehwan Kwon ; Eun-Sol Kim ; Sungwoong Kim
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.LG]

Therefore, in this work, we develop a novel additive learning algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RL) that selectively outputs language tokens between the task-general PLM and the task-specific adapter during both training and inference.

20, TITLE: Dynamic Global Memory for Document-level Argument Extraction
AUTHORS: Xinya Du ; Sha Li ; Heng Ji
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: While recent work on document-level extraction has gone beyond single-sentence and increased the cross-sentence inference capability of end-to-end models, they are still restricted by certain input sequence length constraints and usually ignore the global context between events. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new global neural generation-based framework for document-level event argument extraction by constructing a document memory store to record the contextual event information and leveraging it to implicitly and explicitly help with decoding of arguments for later events.

To address this issue, we propose a Domain- and Instance-level Transfer Framework for Fake News Detection (DITFEND), which could improve the performance of specific target domains.

HIGHLIGHT: Although two-stage Vector Quantized (VQ) generative models allow for synthesizing high-fidelity and high-resolution images, their quantization operator encodes similar patches within an image into the same index, resulting in a repeated artifact for similar adjacent regions using existing decoder architectures. To address this issue, we propose to incorporate the spatially conditional normalization to modulate the quantized vectors so as to insert spatially variant information to the embedded index maps, encouraging the decoder to generate more photorealistic images.

HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose to restore HSIs in a unified approach with an effective plug-and-play method, which can jointly retain the flexibility of optimization-based methods and utilize the powerful representation capability of deep neural networks.

AUTHORS: Zhe Wang ; Hongsheng Li ; Qinwei Zhang ; Jing Yuan ; Xiaogang Wang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a compressed sensing (CS) framework for simultaneously estimating multiple tissue-related parameters based on the MRF method.

244, TITLE: Deep Variation Prior: Joint Image Denoising and Noise Variance Estimation Without Clean Data
AUTHORS: Rihuan Ke
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To address the ill-posedness of the problem, we present deep variation prior (DVP), which states that the variation of a properly learnt denoiser with respect to the change of noise satisfies some smoothness properties, as a key criterion for good denoisers.

245, TITLE: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-assisted Classification of Modulations Using Deep Learning
AUTHORS: MIR LODRO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a RIS-assisted digital classification method based on artificial intelligence.
