AUTHORS: PEI-CHI CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, I.4.0; I.4.8; I.2.10]
HIGHLIGHT: However, it faces two critical weaknesses: 1) the background knowledge does not integrate effectively with foreground features, resulting in a lack of foreground-background coherence (e.g., color discrepancy); 2) the generation process does not prioritize the fidelity of foreground objects, which leads to distortion, particularly for small objects. To address these issues, we propose a Foreground-Aware Camouflaged Image Generation (FACIG) model.
