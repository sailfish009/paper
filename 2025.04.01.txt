CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: The traditional deep learning paradigm that solely relies on labeled data has limitations in representing the spatial relationships between farmland elements and the surrounding environment.It struggles to effectively model the dynamic temporal evolution and spatial heterogeneity of farmland. Language,as a structured knowledge carrier,can explicitly express the spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland, such as its shape, distribution,and surrounding environmental information.Therefore,a language-driven learning paradigm can effectively alleviate the challenges posed by the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of farmland.However,in the field of remote sensing imagery of farmland,there is currently no comprehensive benchmark dataset to support this research direction.To fill this gap,we introduced language based descriptions of farmland and developed FarmSeg-VL dataset,the first fine-grained image-text dataset designed for spatiotemporal farmland segmentation.Firstly, this article proposed a semi-automatic annotation method that can accurately assign caption to each image, ensuring high data quality and semantic richness while improving the efficiency of dataset construction.Secondly,the FarmSeg-VL exhibits significant spatiotemporal characteristics.In terms of the temporal dimension,it covers all four seasons.In terms of the spatial dimension,it covers eight typical agricultural regions across China.In addition, in terms of captions,FarmSeg-VL covers rich spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland,including its inherent properties,phenological characteristics, spatial distribution,topographic and geomorphic features,and the distribution of surrounding environments.Finally,we present a performance analysis of VLMs and the deep learning models that rely solely on labels trained on the FarmSeg-VL,demonstrating its potential as a standard benchmark for farmland segmentation.

HIGHLIGHT: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has made progress in this area, existing methods often suffer from two key limitations: (1) fixed or overly frequent retrieval steps, and (2) ineffective use of previously retrieved knowledge. We propose MIND (Memory-Informed and INteractive Dynamic RAG), a framework that addresses these challenges through: (i) prompt-based entity extraction to identify reasoning-relevant elements, (ii) dynamic retrieval triggering based on token-level entropy and attention signals, and (iii) memory-aware filtering, which stores high-confidence facts across reasoning steps to enable consistent multi-hop generation.

AUTHORS: Hang Yu ; Wei Wei ; Zheng Tan ; Jing-lei Liu
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To reduce the human intervention in the preference measure process,this article proposes a preference collaborative measure framework based on an updated belief system,which is also capable of improving the accuracy and efficiency of preferen-ce measure algorithms.Firstly,the distance of rules and the average internal distance of rulesets are proposed for specifying the relationship between the rules.For discovering the most representative preferences that are common in all users,namely common preference,a algorithm based on average internal distance of ruleset,PRA algorithm,is proposed,which aims to finish the discoveryprocess with minimum information loss rate.Furthermore,the concept of Common belief is proposed to update the belief system,and the common preferences are the evidences of updated belief system.Then,under the belief system,the proposed belief degree and deviation degree are used to determine whether a rule confirms the belief system or not and classify the preference rules into two kinds(generalized or personalized),and eventually filters out Top-K interesting rules relying on belief degree and deviation degree.Based on above,a scalable interestingness calculation framework that can apply various formulas is proposed for accurately calculating interestingness in different conditions.At last,IMCos algorithm and IMCov algorithm are proposed as exemplars to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the framework by using weighted cosine similarity and correlation coefficients as belief degree.In experiments,the proposed algorithms are compared to two state-of-the-art algorithms and the results show that IMCos and IMCov outperform than the other two in most aspects.

378, TITLE: Unsupervised Feature Disentanglement and Augmentation Network for One-class Face Anti-spoofing
AUTHORS: PEI-KAI HUANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While two-class FAS methods risk overfitting to training attacks to achieve better performance, one-class FAS approaches handle unseen attacks well but are less robust to domain information entangled within the liveness features. To address this, we propose an Unsupervised Feature Disentanglement and Augmentation Network (\textbf{UFDANet}), a one-class FAS technique that enhances generalizability by augmenting face images via disentangled features.
