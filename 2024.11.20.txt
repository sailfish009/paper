HIGHLIGHT: Recently, Vaswani et al. [2021] introduced a policy gradient method that corresponds to mirror ascent in the dual space of logits.

150, TITLE: Scaling Deep Learning Research with Kubernetes on The NRP Nautilus HyperCluster
AUTHORS: J. Alex Hurt ; Anes Ouadou ; Mariam Alshehri ; Grant J. Scott
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DC]
HIGHLIGHT: To that end, in this work, we explore utilizing the NRP Nautilus HyperCluster to automate and scale deep learning model training for three separate applications of DNNs, including overhead object detection, burned area segmentation, and deforestation detection.

151, TITLE: Comparing Prior and Learned Time Representations in Transformer Models of Timeseries
AUTHORS: Natalia Koliou ; Tatiana Boura ; Stasinos Konstantopoulos ; George Meramveliotakis ; George Kosmadakis
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In the work described here we study wo different variations of the Transformer architecture: one where we use the fixed time representation proposed in the literature and one where the time representation is learned from the data.

152, TITLE: Data Pruning in Generative Diffusion Models
AUTHORS: Rania Briq ; Jiangtao Wang ; Steffan Kesselheim
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Generative models aim to estimate the underlying distribution of the data, so presumably they should benefit from larger datasets. In this work we aim to shed light on the accuracy of this statement, specifically answer the question of whether data pruning for generative diffusion models could have a positive impact.

153, TITLE: Mechanism and Emergence of Stacked Attention Heads in Multi-Layer Transformers
AUTHORS: Tiberiu Musat
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, I introduce the retrieval problem, a simple reasoning task that can be solved only by transformers with a minimum number of layers.

154, TITLE: Attribute Inference Attacks for Federated Regression Tasks
AUTHORS: FRANCESCO DIANA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR]
HIGHLIGHT: While these attacks have been extensively studied in the context of classification tasks, their impact on regression tasks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing novel model-based AIAs specifically designed for regression tasks in FL environments.

155, TITLE: Visualizing Loss Functions As Topological Landscape Profiles
AUTHORS: CALEB GENIESSE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces a new representation based on topological data analysis that enables the visualization of higher-dimensional loss landscapes.

156, TITLE: Transformer Neural Processes -- Kernel Regression
AUTHORS: DANIEL JENSON et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce the Transformer Neural Process - Kernel Regression (TNP-KR), a new architecture that incorporates a novel transformer block we call a Kernel Regression Block (KRBlock), which reduces the computational complexity of attention in transformer-based Neural Processes (TNPs) from $\mathcal{O}((n_C+n_T)^2)$ to $O(n_C^2+n_Cn_T)$ by eliminating masked computations, where $n_C$ is the number of context, and $n_T$ is the number of test points, respectively, and a fast attention variant that further reduces all attention calculations to $\mathcal{O}(n_C)$ in space and time complexity.

157, TITLE: Just KIDDIN: Knowledge Infusion and Distillation for Detection of INdecent Memes
AUTHORS: RAHUL GARG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) from Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) and knowledge infusion to enhance the performance of toxicity detection in hateful memes.

158, TITLE: The More The Merrier: On Evolving Five-valued Spectra Boolean Functions
AUTHORS: Claude Carlet ; Marko ï¿½urasevic ; Domagoj Jakobovic ; Luca Mariot ; Stjepan Picek
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Moreover, some problems are more interesting as there may be only a few options for generating the required Boolean functions. This paper investigates one such problem: evolving five-valued spectra Boolean functions, which are the functions whose Walsh-Hadamard coefficients can only take five distinct values.

159, TITLE: Error-Feedback Model for Output Correction in Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning
AUTHORS: Hiroshi Sato ; Masashi Konosu ; Sho Sakaino ; Toshiaki Tsuji
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, since neural networks operate in a feedforward structure, they do not possess a mechanism to compensate for output errors. To address this limitation, we developed a feedback mechanism to correct these errors.

160, TITLE: VMGNet: A Low Computational Complexity Robotic Grasping Network Based on VMamba with Multi-Scale Feature Fusion
AUTHORS: YUHAO JIN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While deep learning-based robotic grasping technology has demonstrated strong adaptability, its computational complexity has also significantly increased, making it unsuitable for scenarios with high real-time requirements. Therefore, we propose a low computational complexity and high accuracy model named VMGNet for robotic grasping.
