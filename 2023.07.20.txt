AUTHORS: Yachen Kang ; Li He ; Jinxin Liu ; Zifeng Zhuang ; Donglin Wang
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Due to the existence of similarity trap, such consistency regularization improperly enhances the consistency possiblity of the model's predictions between segment pairs, and thus reduces the confidence in reward learning, since the augmented distribution does not match with the original one in PbRL. To overcome such issue, we present a self-training method along with our proposed peer regularization, which penalizes the reward model memorizing uninformative labels and acquires confident predictions.

128, TITLE: Automatic Conversion of MiniZinc Programs to QUBO
AUTHORS: Armin Wolf ; Cristian Grozea
CATEGORY: cs.MS [cs.MS, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Obtaining Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation models for various optimisation problems, in order to solve those on physical quantum computers (such as the the DWave annealers) is nowadays a lengthy and tedious process that requires one to remodel all problem variables as binary variables and squeeze the target function and the constraints into a single quadratic polynomial into these new variables. We report here on the basis of our automatic converter from MiniZinc to QUBO, which is able to process a large set of constraint optimisation and constraint satisfaction problems and turn them into equivalent QUBOs, effectively optimising the whole process.
