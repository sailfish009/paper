75, TITLE: D^2USt3R: Enhancing 3D Reconstruction with 4D Pointmaps for Dynamic Scenes
AUTHORS: JISANG HAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although these methods provide an elegant and powerful solution in static settings, they struggle in the presence of dynamic motions that disrupt alignment based solely on camera poses. To overcome this, we propose D^2USt3R that regresses 4D pointmaps that simultaneiously capture both static and dynamic 3D scene geometry in a feed-forward manner.

76, TITLE: GOLLuM: Gaussian Process Optimized LLMs -- Reframing LLM Finetuning Through Bayesian Optimization
AUTHORS: Bojana Rankovi? ; Philippe Schwaller

HIGHLIGHT: We address this gap with a novel architecture that reframes LLM finetuning as Gaussian process (GP) marginal likelihood optimization via deep kernel methods. We introduce LLM-based deep kernels, jointly optimized with GPs to preserve the benefits of both - LLMs to provide a rich and flexible input space for Bayesian optimization and - GPs to model this space with predictive uncertainty for more efficient sampling.

AUTHORS: Robert Andrews ; Deepanshu Kush ; Roei Tell
CATEGORY: cs.CC [cs.CC]
HIGHLIGHT: In particular, a main goal has been to understand which lower bounds suffice to obtain efficient PIT algorithms, and how close are they to lower bounds that are necessary for the conclusion. We construct polynomial-time PIT algorithms from lower bounds that are, up to relatively minor remaining gaps, necessary for the existence of such algorithms.

CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: A common solution is to apply a dimensionality reduction (DR) layer, but this approach increases parameter overhead, computational costs, and risks losing valuable information. To address these issues, we propose Nested Res2Net (Nes2Net), a lightweight back-end architecture designed to directly process high-dimensional features without DR layers.

92, TITLE: Uncovering Fairness Through Data Complexity As An Early Indicator
AUTHORS: Juliett Su�rez Ferreira ; Marija Slavkovik ; Jorge Casillas
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DS]
HIGHLIGHT: Currently, there is no study on how disparities in classification complexity between privileged and unprivileged groups could influence the fairness of solutions, which serves as a preliminary indicator of potential unfairness. In this work, we investigate this gap, specifically, we focus on synthetic datasets designed to capture a variety of biases ranging from historical bias to measurement and representational bias to evaluate how various complexity metrics differences correlate with group fairness metrics.

To address these challenges, we propose an approach named iEBAKER (an Improved Eliminate Before Align strategy with Keyword Explicit Reasoning framework) for RSITR.

109, TITLE: Heuristic Methods Are Good Teachers to Distill MLPs for Graph Link Prediction
AUTHORS: ZONGYUE QIN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism.

AUTHORS: Saad Wazir ; Daeyoung Kim
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In medical image segmentation, where data samples are often limited, state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods improve accuracy by using pre-trained encoders, while end-to-end approaches typically fall short due to difficulties in transferring multiscale features effectively between encoders and decoders. To handle these challenges, we introduce a nested UNet architecture that captures both local and global context through Multiscale Feature Fusion and Attention Mechanisms.

127, TITLE: Multi-fidelity Reinforcement Learning Control for Complex Dynamical Systems
AUTHORS: LUNING SUN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]

To bridge this gap, the current work proposes a multi-fidelity reinforcement learning (MFRL) framework that leverages differentiable hybrid models for control tasks, where a physics-based hybrid model is corrected by limited high-fidelity data.

CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Video-Question-Answering (VideoQA) comprises the capturing of complex visual relation changes over time, remaining a challenge even for advanced Video Language Models (VLM), i.a., because of the need to represent the visual content to a reasonably sized input for those models. To address this problem, we propose RElation-based Video rEpresentAtion Learning (REVEAL), a framework designed to capture visual relation information by encoding them into structured, decomposed representations.

AUTHORS: Yuxuan Li ; Ning Yang ; Stephen Xia
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Additionally, these tasks often feature hidden "trap states" -- irreversible failures that prevent task completion but do not provide explicit negative rewards to guide agents away from repeated errors. To address these issues, we propose Time-Weighted Contrastive Reward Learning (TW-CRL), an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that leverages both successful and failed demonstrations.

135, TITLE: Gaze-Guided Learning: Avoiding Shortcut Bias in Visual Classification

AUTHORS: V�STEINN SN�BJARNARSON et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Second, a useful classification measure should give partial credit to less-specific, but not incorrect, answers ('norway spruce' being a type of 'conifer').

139, TITLE: Point-based Instance Completion with Scene Constraints
AUTHORS: Wesley Khademi ; Li Fuxin
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While instance scene completion methods have been proposed for completing objects within a scene, they lag behind point-based object completion methods in terms of object completion quality and still do not consider known scene constraints during completion. To overcome these limitations, we propose a point cloud-based instance completion model that can robustly complete objects at arbitrary scales and pose in the scene.

158, TITLE: Biomechanical Constraints Assimilation in Deep-Learning Image Registration: Application to Sliding and Locally Rigid Deformations
AUTHORS: Ziad Kheil ; Soleakhena Ken ; Laurent Risser
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, 2008 (Primary) 68U10, 68T99, 62P10, 74L15 (Secondary)]
HIGHLIGHT: Lacking structural awareness, these strategies may fail to consider a panoply of spatially inhomogeneous deformation properties, which would faithfully account for the biomechanics of soft and hard tissues, especially in poorly contrasted structures. To bridge this gap, we propose a learning-based image registration approach in which the inferred deformation properties can locally adapt themselves to trained biomechanical characteristics.
