HIGHLIGHT: This work presents an algorithm for scene change detection from point clouds to enable autonomous robotic caretaking in future space habitats.

166, TITLE: PolyFit: A Peg-in-hole Assembly Framework for Unseen Polygon Shapes Via Sim-to-real Adaptation
AUTHORS: GEONHYUP LEE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: The study proposes a sim-to-real adaptation method for real-world application, using a sim-real paired dataset to enable effective generalization to complex and unseen polygon shapes.

167, TITLE: Working Backwards: Learning to Place By Picking
AUTHORS: OLIVER LIMOYO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We present Learning to Place by Picking (LPP), a method capable of autonomously collecting demonstrations for a family of placing tasks in which objects must be manipulated to specific locations.

168, TITLE: CityTFT: Temporal Fusion Transformer for Urban Building Energy Modeling
AUTHORS: Ting-Yu Dai ; Dev Niyogi ; Zoltan Nagy
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This work proposes CityTFT, a data-driven UBEM framework, to accurately model the energy demands in urban environments.

169, TITLE: MEDPSeg: End-to-end Segmentation of Pulmonary Structures and Lesions in Computed Tomography
AUTHORS: DIEDRE S. CARMO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We combined over 6000 volumetric CT scans containing varying formats of manual and automated labels from different sources, and used polymorphic training along with multitask learning to develop MEDPSeg, an end-to-end method for the segmentation of lungs, airways, pulmonary artery, and lung lesions with separation of ground glass opacities, and parenchymal consolidations, all in a single forward prediction.

170, TITLE: Fast CT Anatomic Localization Algorithm
AUTHORS: Amit Oved
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This algorithm was tested on thousands of scans and proves to be very reliable and useful as a preprocessing stage for many applications.

171, TITLE: Choroidalyzer: An Open-source, End-to-end Pipeline for Choroidal Analysis in Optical Coherence Tomography
AUTHORS: JUSTIN ENGELMANN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT: Methods: We used 5,600 OCT B-scans (233 subjects, 6 systemic disease cohorts, 3 device types, 2 manufacturers).

172, TITLE: Accelerating Learnt Video Codecs with Gradient Decay and Layer-wise Distillation
AUTHORS: Tianhao Peng ; Ge Gao ; Heming Sun ; Fan Zhang ; David Bull
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present a novel model-agnostic pruning scheme based on gradient decay and adaptive layer-wise distillation.

173, TITLE: Explainable Severity Ranking Via Pairwise N-hidden Comparison: A Case Study of Glaucoma
AUTHORS: Hong Nguyen ; Cuong V. Nguyen ; Shrikanth Narayanan ; Benjamin Y. Xu ; Michael Pazzani
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we build a framework to rank, compare, and interpret the severity of glaucoma using fundus images.
