AUTHORS: JUNHONG WU et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: Recent advancements aim to addressthis limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft,abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs byexamining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques.Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneousexploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMspredominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs duringsubsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of differentreasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding,obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and theGumbel-Softmax trick.

193, TITLE: BadBlocks: Low-Cost and Stealthy Backdoor Attacks Tailored for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
AUTHORS: Yu Pan ; Jiahao Chen ; Lin Wang ; Bingrong Dai ; Yi Du
CATEGORY: cs.CR [cs.CR, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In recent years,Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in thefield of image generation.However,recent studies have shown that diffusionmodels are susceptible to backdoor attacks,in which attackers can manipulatethe output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns ortextual phrases into the training dataset.Fortunately,with the continuousadvancement of defense techniques,defenders have become increasingly capable ofidentifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection andneural network-based detection methods.However,in this paper,we identify anovel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existingapproaches,which we name BadBlocks,requires only about 30\% of thecomputational resources and 20\% GPU time typically needed by previous backdoorattacks,yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanceddefense frameworks.BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminatespecific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models whilemaintaining normal functionality in the remaining components.Experimentalresults demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate (ASR)and low perceptual quality loss (as measured by FID Score),even under extremelyconstrained computational resources and GPU time.Moreover,BadBlocks is able tobypass existing defense frameworks,especially the attention-based backdoordetection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat.Ablationstudies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not requirefine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neuralnetwork layers in backdoor mapping.Overall,BadBlocks significantly reduces thebarrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects.It enables attackers toinject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-gradeGPUs.

HIGHLIGHT: Despite these compelling empirical results and cleartheoretical advantages, the practical adoption and public availability of lateinteraction models remain low compared to their single-vector counterparts,primarily due to a lack of accessible and modular tools for training andexperimenting with such models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PyLate, astreamlined library built on top of Sentence Transformers to supportmulti-vector architectures natively, inheriting its efficient training,advanced logging, and automated model card generation while requiring minimalcode changes to code templates users are already familiar with.
