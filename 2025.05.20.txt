Building on these observations, we introduce the Koopman Distillation Model KDM, a novel offline distillation approach grounded in Koopman theory-a classical framework for representing nonlinear dynamics linearly in a transformed space.

To fulfill this gap, we propose \texttt{DialogTool}, a multi-turn dialogue dataset with stateful tool interactions considering the whole life cycle of tool use, across six key tasks in three stages: 1) \textit{tool creation}; 2) \textit{tool utilization}: tool awareness, tool selection, tool execution; and 3) \textit{role-consistent response}: response generation and role play.

AUTHORS: CHENYANG YANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.SE]
HIGHLIGHT: Building LLM-powered software requires developers to communicate their requirements through natural language, but developer prompts are frequently underspecified, failing to fully capture many user-important requirements. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of prompt underspecification, showing that while LLMs can often (41.1%) guess unspecified requirements by default, such behavior is less robust: Underspecified prompts are 2x more likely to regress over model or prompt changes, sometimes with accuracy drops by more than 20%.

AUTHORS: Qichen Sun ; Zhengrui Guo ; Rui Peng ; Hao Chen ; Jinzhuo Wang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]

To address these challenges, we propose ALTER, an any-to-any tri-modal pretraining framework that integrates WSIs, genomics, and pathology reports.

AUTHORS: Rui Liu ; Rui Xie ; Zijun Yao ; Yanjie Fu ; Dongjie Wang
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, two key limitations remain: 1) embedding feature subsets in a continuous space is challenging due to permutation sensitivity, as changes in feature order can introduce biases and weaken the embedding learning process; 2) gradient-based search in the embedding space assumes convexity, which is rarely guaranteed, leading to reduced search effectiveness and suboptimal subsets. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework that can: 1) preserve feature subset knowledge in a continuous embedding space while ensuring permutation invariance; 2) effectively explore the embedding space without relying on strong convex assumptions.

HIGHLIGHT: A naive solution is to retrieve domain-specific documents and extract all QA pairs from them, but this faces two key challenges: (1) extracting all QA pairs using LLMs is prohibitively expensive, and (2) many extracted QA pairs may be irrelevant to the downstream tasks, potentially degrading model performance. To tackle these issues, we introduce EQUAL, an effective and scalable data extraction framework that iteratively alternates between document selection and high-quality QA pair extraction to enhance instruction tuning.

Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to other compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce runtime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small matrices.

CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While recent advancements in large scale vision language models (VLMs, e.g. GPT4o) might suggest that increasing model and training dataset size would mitigate this issue, our empirical evaluation shows a more complicated picture. Testing models using two classic uncertainty quantification tasks, anomaly detection and classification under inherently ambiguous conditions, we find that newer and larger VLMs indeed exhibit improved robustness compared to earlier models, but still suffer from a tendency to strictly follow instructions, often causing them to hallucinate confident responses even when faced with unclear or anomalous inputs.
