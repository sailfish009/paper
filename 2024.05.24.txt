For these settings, we propose "Scaffolder", a reinforcement learning approach which effectively exploits privileged sensing in critics, world models, reward estimators, and other such auxiliary components that are only used at training time, to improve the target policy.

HIGHLIGHT: However, these features may face challenges in accurately identifying closely related pronunciation of audio-text pairs, due to their limited capability in capturing the temporal dynamics of the speech signal. To address this challenge, we propose to use shifted delta coefficients (SDC) which help in capturing pronunciation variability (transition between connecting phonemes) by incorporating long-term temporal information.

323, TITLE: Multi-modality Regional Alignment Network for Covid X-Ray Survival Prediction and Report Generation
AUTHORS: ZHUSI ZHONG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This study proposes Multi-modality Regional Alignment Network (MRANet), an explainable model for radiology report generation and survival prediction that focuses on high-risk regions.

324, TITLE: MAMOC: MRI Motion Correction Via Masked Autoencoding
AUTHORS: Lennart Alexander Van der Goten ; Jingyu Guo ; Kevin Smith
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces Masked Motion Correction (MAMOC), a novel method designed to address the issue of Retrospective Artifact Correction (RAC) in motion-affected MRI brain scans.
