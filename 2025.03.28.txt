AUTHORS: ZACHARY GRANNAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, fully understanding, extracting and exploiting these guarantees is subtle and challenging: existing models for Rust's type checking either support a smaller idealised language disconnected from real-world Rust code, or come with severe limitations in terms of precise modelling of Rust borrows, composite types storing them, function signatures and loops. In this paper, we present a novel model of Rust's type-checking called Place Capability Graphs, which lifts these limitations, and which can be directly calculated from the Rust compiler's own programmatic representations and analyses.

HIGHLIGHT: However, compared to their non-private equivalents, these approaches suffer from a poor utility. To improve the privacy-utility trade-off, we present a modification to these vanilla differentially private algorithms based on a Haar wavelet transformation step and a novel noise injection scheme that significantly lowers the asymptotic bound of the noise variance.

237, TITLE: Adaptive Resampling with Bootstrap for Noisy Multi-Objective Optimization Problems
AUTHORS: Timo Budszuhn ; Mark Joachim Krallmann ; Daniel Horn
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML, 90C29, G.1.6]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents a resampling decision function that incorporates the stochastic nature of the optimization problem by using bootstrapping and the probability of dominance.

238, TITLE: Improved Runtime Analysis of A Multi-Valued Compact Genetic Algorithm on Two Generalized OneMax Problems
AUTHORS: Sumit Adak ; Carsten Witt
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present the first theoretical runtime analysis of the r-cGA on the G-OneMax function.

239, TITLE: MONO2REST: Identifying and Exposing Microservices: A Reusable RESTification Approach
AUTHORS: Matth�o Lecrivain ; Hanifa Barry ; Dalila Tamzalit ; Houari Sahraoui
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present a reusable, automated, two-phase approach that combines evolutionary algorithms with machine learning techniques.

241, TITLE: Sparse Bayesian Learning for Label Efficiency in Cardiac Real-Time MRI
AUTHORS: FELIX TERHAG et. al.
CATEGORY: stat.ME [stat.ME, cs.CV, math.PR, math.ST, stat.AP, stat.TH, 62F15, 92C55, 62P10, 94A12, 62F07, 62K99, G.3; J.3]
HIGHLIGHT: Although neural networks perform well on inner slices, predictions on outer slices are often unreliable. This work proposes sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) to predict the ventricular volume on outer slices with minimal manual labeling to address this challenge.
