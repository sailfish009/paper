14, TITLE: Mitigating Metric Bias in Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding
AUTHORS: Geza Kovacs ; Daniel Deutsch ; Markus Freitag

In this work we find that compared to human ratings, neural metrics not only overestimate the quality of MBR decoding when the same metric is used as the utility metric, but they also overestimate the quality of MBR/QE decoding with other neural utility metrics as well.
