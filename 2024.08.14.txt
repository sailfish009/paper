HIGHLIGHT: While notable studies use intrinsic motivation (IM) to address reward sparsity or cooperation in decentralized settings, those dealing with heterogeneity typically assume centralized training, parameter sharing, and agent indexing. To overcome these limitations, we propose the CoHet algorithm, which utilizes a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) based intrinsic motivation to facilitate the learning of heterogeneous agent policies in decentralized settings, under the challenges of partial observability and reward sparsity.

161, TITLE: VNet: A GAN-based Multi-Tier Discriminator Network for Speech Synthesis Vocoders
AUTHORS: Yubing Cao ; Yongming Li ; Liejun Wang ; Yinfeng Yu
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, previous studies have revealed that the use of full-band spectral information as input can result in the issue of over-smoothing, compromising the naturalness of the synthesized speech. To tackle this challenge, we propose VNet, a GAN-based neural vocoder network that incorporates full-band spectral information and introduces a Multi-Tier Discriminator (MTD) comprising multiple sub-discriminators to generate high-resolution signals.
