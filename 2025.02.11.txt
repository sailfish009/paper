To address this issue, we use the software MATHCHECK to generate certificates for Ramsey problems R(3, 8) and R(3, 9) (and symmetrically R(8, 3) and R(9, 3)) by integrating a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver with a computer algebra system (CAS).

To tackle this, we propose a Collaborative learning-based OLHTR framework, called Col-OLHTR, that learns multimodal features during training while maintaining a single-stream inference process.
