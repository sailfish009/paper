AUTHORS: ANA STANOJEVIC et. al.

After identifying this issue we derive a generic solution for the network initialization and SNN parameterization which guarantees that the SNN can be trained as robustly as its ANN counterpart.

AUTHORS: Feynman Liang ; Liam Hodgkinson ; Michael W. Mahoney

HIGHLIGHT: Despite the successes of probabilistic models based on passing noise through neural networks, recent work has identified that such methods often fail to capture tail behavior accurately, unless the tails of the base distribution are appropriately calibrated. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a systematic approach for analyzing the tails of random variables, and we illustrate how this approach can be used during the static analysis (before drawing samples) pass of a probabilistic programming language compiler.

To tackle this crucial issue, in contrast to existing methods with empirically-designed architectures, we propose probabilistic-based feature embedding (PFE), which learns a feature embedding architecture by assembling various low-dimensional convolution patterns in a probability space for fully capturing spatial-angular information.
