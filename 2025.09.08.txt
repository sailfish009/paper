156, TITLE: Forall-Exists Relational Verification By Filtering to Forall-Forall
AUTHORS: Ramana Nagasamudram ; Anindya Banerjee ; David A. Naumann
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.PL, F.3.1; F.3.2]
HIGHLIGHT: In contrast, few logics andtools exist for reasoning about $\forall\exists$ properties which are criticalin the context of nondeterminism. This paper's primary contribution is a methodology for verifying a$\forall\exists$ judgment by way of a novel filter-adequacy transformation.This transformation adds assertions to a product program in such a way that thedesired $\forall\exists$ property (of a pair of underlying unary programs) isimplied by a $\forall\forall$ property of the transformed product.

HIGHLIGHT: As the complexity of artificial agents increases, the design of environmentsthat can effectively shape their behavior and capabilities has become acritical research frontier. We propose a framework that extends this principleto a novel class of agents: biological neural networks in the form of neuralorganoids.

160, TITLE: Code Review Without Borders: Evaluating Synthetic Vs. Real Data for Review Recommendation
AUTHORS: Yogev Cohen ; Dudi Ohayon ; Romy Somkin ; Yehudit Aperstein ; Alexander Apartsin
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Automating the decision of whether a code change requires manual review isvital for maintaining software quality in modern development workflows.However, the emergence of new programming languages and frameworks creates acritical bottleneck: while large volumes of unlabelled code are readilyavailable, there is an insufficient amount of labelled data to train supervisedmodels for review classification. We address this challenge by leveraging LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) to translate code changes from well-resourced languagesinto equivalent changes in underrepresented or emerging languages, generatingsynthetic training data where labelled examples are scarce.
