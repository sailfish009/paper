CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent advanced approaches, which are joint models based on graphs, might still face two potential issues: (i) the uncertainty introduced by constructing graphs based on preliminary intents and slots, which may transfer intent-slot correlation information to incorrect label node destinations, and (ii) direct incorporation of multiple intent labels for each token w.r.t. token-level intent voting might potentially lead to incorrect slot predictions, thereby hurting the overall performance. To address these two issues, we propose a joint model named MISCA.
