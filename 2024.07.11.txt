HIGHLIGHT: Similar to the safety metrics for object detection, additional factors such as the semantics of the scene with road type and road width, the detection range as well as the potential causes of missing detections, incorporated by vehicle speed, should be considered for the evaluation of lane detection. Therefore, we propose the Lane Safety Metric (LSM), which takes these factors into account and allows to evaluate the safety of lane detection systems by determining an easily interpretable safety score.

162, TITLE: ActionVOS: Actions As Prompts for Video Object Segmentation
AUTHORS: Liangyang Ouyang ; Ruicong Liu ; Yifei Huang ; Ryosuke Furuta ; Yoichi Sato
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing RVOS task primarily relies on static attributes such as object names to segment target objects, posing challenges in distinguishing target objects from background objects and in identifying objects undergoing state changes. To address these problems, this work proposes a novel action-aware RVOS setting called ActionVOS, aiming at segmenting only active objects in egocentric videos using human actions as a key language prompt.

185, TITLE: Uncovering Layer-Dependent Activation Sparsity Patterns in ReLU Transformers
AUTHORS: Cody Wild ; Jesper Anderson
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Previous work has demonstrated that MLPs within ReLU Transformers exhibit high levels of sparsity, with many of their activations equal to zero for any given token. We build on that work to more deeply explore how token-level sparsity evolves over the course of training, and how it connects to broader sparsity patterns over the course of a sequence or batch, demonstrating that the different layers within small transformers exhibit distinctly layer-specific patterns on both of these fronts.
