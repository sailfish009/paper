CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While model development and validation are primarily conducted on idealistic scenes, geometric domain shifts, such as occlusions of the situs, are common in real-world open surgeries. To close this gap, we (1) present the first analysis of state-of-the-art (SOA) semantic segmentation models when faced with geometric out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and (2) propose an augmentation technique called "Organ Transplantation", to enhance generalizability.

163, TITLE: Measuring The Reliability of Causal Probing Methods: Tradeoffs, Limitations, and The Plight of Nullifying Interventions
AUTHORS: Marc Canby ; Adam Davies ; Chirag Rastogi ; Julia Hockenmaier
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: While some recent works have cast doubt on the theoretical basis of several leading causal probing intervention methods, it has been unclear how to systematically and empirically evaluate their effectiveness in practice. To address this problem, we propose a general empirical analysis framework to evaluate the reliability of causal probing interventions, formally defining and quantifying two key causal probing desiderata: completeness (fully transforming the representation of the target property) and selectivity (minimally impacting other properties).

168, TITLE: Omega: The Power of Visual Simplicity
AUTHORS: Benoit Sonntag ; Dominique Colnet
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: We are currently developing an innovative and visually-driven programming language called Omega.Although the Omega code is stored in text files, these files are not intended for manual editing or traditional printing.Furthermore, parsing these files using a context-free grammar is not possible.The parsing of the code and the facilitation of user-friendly manual editing both necessitate a global knowledge of the codebase.Strictly speaking, code visualization is not an integral part of the Omega language; instead, this task is delegated to the editing tools.Thanks to the global knowledge of the code, the editing process becomes remarkably straightforward, with numerous automatic completion features that enhance usability.Omega leverages a visual-oriented approach to encompass all fundamental aspects of software engineering.It offers robust features, including safe static typing, design by contracts, rules for accessing slots, operator definitions, and more,all presented in an intuitively and visually comprehensible manner, eliminating the need for obscure syntax.

AUTHORS: Gus Henry Smith
