HIGHLIGHT: Existing attempts to quantify the statistical benefits of these biases in CNNs over locally connected convolutional neural networks (LCNs) and fully connected neural networks (FCNs) fall into one of the following categories: either they disregard the optimizer and only provide uniform convergence upper bounds with no separating lower bounds, or they consider simplistic tasks that do not truly mirror the locality and translation invariance as found in real-world vision tasks. To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Dynamic Signal Distribution (DSD) classification task that models an image as consisting of $k$ patches, each of dimension $d$, and the label is determined by a $d$-sparse signal vector that can freely appear in any one of the $k$ patches.

158, TITLE: LLMs Instruct LLMs:An Extraction and Editing Method
AUTHORS: Xin Zhang ; Tianjie Ju ; Huijia Liang ; Ying Fu ; Qin Zhang

HIGHLIGHT: The interest in updating Large Language Models (LLMs) without retraining from scratch is substantial, yet it comes with some challenges.This is especially true for situations demanding complex reasoning with limited samples, a scenario we refer to as the Paucity-Constrained Complex Reasoning Adaptation for LLMs (PCRA-LLM). Traditional methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are inadequate for this critical issue, particularly evident in our exploration of a specific medical context that epitomize the PCRA-LLM's distinct needs.To address the issue, we propose a Sequential Fusion method to incorporate knowledge from complex context into LLMs.
