1, TITLE: GDPO: Group Reward-Decoupled Normalization Policy Optimization for Multi-reward RL Optimization
AUTHORS: SHIH-YANG LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, recent work has defaulted to apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) under multi-reward setting without examining its suitability. In this paper, we demonstrate that directly applying GRPO to normalize distinct rollout reward combinations causes them to collapse into identical advantage values, reducing the resolution of the training signal and resulting in suboptimal convergence and, in some cases, early training failure.

Leveraging these observations, we introduce PackCache, a training-free KV-cache management method that dynamically compacts the KV cache through three coordinated mechanisms: condition anchoring that preserves semantic references, cross-frame decay modeling that allocates cache budget according to temporal distance, and spatially preserving position embedding that maintains coherent 3D structure under cache removal.

To address this limitation, we propose Gated Perception-Reasoning Optimization (GPRO), a meta-reasoning controller that dynamically routes computation among three decision paths at each generation step: a lightweight fast path, a slow perception path for re-examining visual inputs, and a slow reasoning path for internal self-reflection.

AUTHORS: Yueqing Hu ; Xinyang Peng ; Shuting Peng ; Hanqi Wang ; Tianhong Wang

Testing the "H�n D?n Xu� B�" (Superficial Mimicry) hypothesis across 14 models, we find that distillation induces a "Functional Alignment Collapse": while teacher models mirror human difficulty scaling ($\bar{r}=0.64$), distilled students significantly degrade this alignment ($\bar{r}=0.34$), often underperforming their own pre-distillation baselines ("Negative Transfer").

AUTHORS: Jusheng Zhang ; Yijia Fan ; Zimo Wen ; Jian Wang ; Keze Wang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Driven by applications in autonomous driving robotics and augmented reality 3D object annotation presents challenges beyond 2D annotation including spatial complexity occlusion and viewpoint inconsistency Existing approaches based on single models often struggle to address these issues effectively We propose Tri MARF a novel framework that integrates tri modal inputs including 2D multi view images textual descriptions and 3D point clouds within a multi agent collaborative architecture to enhance large scale 3D annotation Tri MARF consists of three specialized agents a vision language model agent for generating multi view descriptions an information aggregation agent for selecting optimal descriptions and a gating agent that aligns textual semantics with 3D geometry for refined captioning Extensive experiments on Objaverse LVIS Objaverse XL and ABO demonstrate that Tri MARF substantially outperforms existing methods achieving a CLIPScore of 88 point 7 compared to prior state of the art methods retrieval accuracy of 45 point 2 and 43 point 8 on ViLT R at 5 and a throughput of up to 12000 objects per hour on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU  [Save to Library]

79, TITLE: RAAR: Retrieval Augmented Agentic Reasoning for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection
AUTHORS: ZHIWEI LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing methods often rely on single-perspective cues and struggle to generalize to challenging or underrepresented domains, while reasoning large language models (LLMs), though effective on complex tasks, are limited to same-distribution data. To address these gaps, we introduce RAAR, the first retrieval-augmented agentic reasoning framework for cross-domain misinformation detection.  [Save to Library]

80, TITLE: MisSpans: Fine-Grained False Span Identification in Cross-Domain Fake News
AUTHORS: ZHIWEI LIU et. al.

To address these gaps, we introduce MisSpans, the first multi-domain, human-annotated benchmark for span-level misinformation detection and analysis, consisting of paired real and fake news stories.

92, TITLE: DVD: A Robust Method for Detecting Variant Contamination in Large Language Model Evaluation
AUTHORS: RENZHAO LIANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Unlike verbatim leakage, these paraphrased or structurally transformed variants evade existing detectors based on sampling consistency or perplexity, thereby inflating benchmark scores via memorization rather than genuine reasoning. We formalize this problem and introduce \textbf{DVD} (\textbf{D}etection via \textbf{V}ariance of generation \textbf{D}istribution), a single-sample detector that models the local output distribution induced by temperature sampling.

93, TITLE: Beyond Monolithic Architectures: A Multi-Agent Search and Knowledge Optimization Framework for Agentic Search
AUTHORS: YIQUN CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, prevailing systems rely on monolithic agents that suffer from structural bottlenecks, including unconstrained reasoning outputs that inflate trajectories, sparse outcome-level rewards that complicate credit assignment, and stochastic search noise that destabilizes learning. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{M-ASK} (Multi-Agent Search and Knowledge), a framework that explicitly decouples agentic search into two complementary roles: Search Behavior Agents, which plan and execute search actions, and Knowledge Management Agents, which aggregate, filter, and maintain a compact internal context.

AUTHORS: YIHONG TANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Current role-playing agents (RPAs) are typically constructed by imitating surface-level behaviors, but this approach lacks internal cognitive consistency, often causing out-of-character errors in complex situations. To address this, we propose Character-R1, a framework designed to provide comprehensive verifiable reward signals for effective role-aware reasoning, which are missing in recent studies.
