AUTHORS: Nadine Kroher ; Steven Manangu ; Aggelos Pikrakis
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.IR, cs.LG, eess.AS, I.2]
HIGHLIGHT: As an alternative, we investigate the extent to which synthetically generated music excerpts can improve tagging systems when only small annotated collections are available.

238, TITLE: Deepfake Audio Detection Using Spectrogram-based Feature and Ensemble of Deep Learning Models
AUTHORS: Lam Pham ; Phat Lam ; Truong Nguyen ; Huyen Nguyen ; Alexander Schindler
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a deep learning based system for the task of deepfake audio detection.

239, TITLE: Let It Shine: Autofluorescence of Papanicolaou-stain Improves AI-based Cytological Oral Cancer Detection
AUTHORS: Wenyi Lian ; Joakim Lindblad ; Christina Runow Stark ; Jan-Micha�l Hirsch ; Nata?a Sladoje
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This study aims to improve AI-based oral cancer detection using multimodal imaging and deep fusion.

240, TITLE: Characterizing The Interpretability of Attention Maps in Digital Pathology
AUTHORS: Tom� Albuquerque ; Anil Y�ce ; Markus D. Herrmann ; Alvaro Gomariz
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We herein propose a framework to assess the ability of attention networks to attend to relevant features in digital pathology by creating artificial model confounders and using dedicated interpretability metrics.

241, TITLE: AXIAL: Attention-based EXplainability for Interpretable Alzheimer's Localized Diagnosis Using 2D CNNs on 3D MRI Brain Scans
AUTHORS: Gabriele Lozupone ; Alessandro Bria ; Francesco Fontanella ; Claudio De Stefano
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, 41A05 41A10 65D05 65D17]
HIGHLIGHT: This study presents an innovative method for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using 3D MRI designed to enhance the explainability of model decisions.
