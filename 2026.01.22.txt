5, TITLE: VisTIRA: Closing The Image-Text Modality Gap in Visual Math Reasoning Via Structured Tool Integration
AUTHORS: Saeed Khaki; Ashudeep Singh; Nima Safaei; Kamal Ginotra
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Vision-language models (VLMs) lag behind text-only language models on mathematical reasoning when the same problems are presented as images rather than text. We empirically characterize this as a modality gap: the same question in text form yields markedly higher accuracy than its visually typeset counterpart, due to compounded failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context.

AUTHORS: Shantanu Jaiswal; Mihir Prabhudesai; Nikash Bhardwaj; Zheyang Qin; Amir Zadeh; Chuan Li; Katerina Fragkiadaki; Deepak Pathak
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop.

AUTHORS: Shuai Wang; Yaoming Yang; Bingdong Li; Hao Hao; Aimin Zhou
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Although large language models (LLMs) offer rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation, applying them to long-horizon LPR is challenging due to (i) misalignment with pedagogical objectives such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) under sparse, delayed feedback, (ii) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (iii) multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length controllability, and trajectory diversity. To address these issues, we propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization), an indicator-guided alignment approach for LLM-based LPR.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Interpretability is significant in computational pathology, leading to the development of multimodal information integration from histopathological image and corresponding text data.However, existing multimodal methods have limited interpretability due to the lack of high-quality dataset that support explicit reasoning and inference and simple reasoning process.To address the above problems, we introduce a novel multimodal pathology large language model with strong reasoning capabilities.To improve the generation of accurate and contextually relevant textual descriptions, we design a semantic reward strategy integrated with group relative policy optimization.We construct a high-quality pathology visual question answering (VQA) dataset, specifically designed to support complex reasoning tasks.Comprehensive experiments conducted on this dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even when trained with only 20% of the data.Our method also achieves comparable performance on downstream zero-shot image classification task compared with CLIP.

220, TITLE: FunCineForge: A Unified Dataset Toolkit and Model for Zero-Shot Movie Dubbing in Diverse Cinematic Scenes
AUTHORS: Jiaxuan Liu; Yang Xiang; Han Zhao; Xiangang Li; Zhenhua Ling
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing methods face two major limitations: (1) high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets are limited in scale, suffer from high word error rates, contain sparse annotations, rely on costly manual labeling, and are restricted to monologue scenes, all of which hinder effective model training; (2) existing dubbing models rely solely on the lip region to learn audio-visual alignment, which limits their applicability to complex live-action cinematic scenes, and exhibit suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose FunCineForge, which comprises an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes.
