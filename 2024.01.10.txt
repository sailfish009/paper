85, TITLE: Enhanced Distribution Alignment for Post-Training Quantization of Diffusion Models
AUTHORS: Xuewen Liu ; Zhikai Li ; Junrui Xiao ; Qingyi Gu

In this paper, we propose Enhanced Distribution Alignment for Post-Training Quantization of Diffusion Models (EDA-DM) to address the above issues.
