27, TITLE: Modeling Complex Dialogue Mappings Via Sentence Semantic Segmentation Guided Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder
AUTHORS: BIN SUN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Complex dialogue mappings (CDM), including one-to-many and many-to-one mappings, tend to make dialogue models generate incoherent or dull responses, and modeling these mappings remains a huge challenge for neural dialogue systems. To alleviate these problems, methods like introducing external information, reconstructing the optimization function, and manipulating data samples are proposed, while they primarily focus on avoiding training with CDM, inevitably weakening the model's ability of understanding CDM in human conversations and limiting further improvements in model performance.

47, TITLE: Shape-Guided Diffusion with Inside-Outside Attention
AUTHORS: DONG HUK PARK et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Shape can specify key object constraints, yet existing text-to-image diffusion models ignore this cue and synthesize objects that are incorrectly scaled, cut off, or replaced with background content. We propose a training-free method, Shape-Guided Diffusion, which uses a novel Inside-Outside Attention mechanism to constrain the cross-attention (and self-attention) maps such that prompt tokens (and pixels) referring to the inside of the shape cannot attend outside the shape, and vice versa.
