127, TITLE: Remember Me: Bridging The Long-Range Gap in LVLMs with Three-Step Inference-Only Decay Resilience Strategies
AUTHORS: Peng Gao; Yujian Lee; Xiaofeng Zhang; Zailong Chen; Hui Zhang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence.

AUTHORS: Xurui Li; Feng Xue; Yu Zhou
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we reveal a key property that is overlooked by existing methods: normal image patches across industrial products typically find many other similar patches, not only in 2D appearance but also in 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. To explicitly leverage this discriminative property, we propose a Mutual Scoring framework (MuSc-V2) for zero-shot AC/AS, which flexibly supports single 2D/3D or multimodality.
