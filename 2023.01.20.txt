10, TITLE: JCSE: Contrastive Learning of Japanese Sentence Embeddings and Its Applications
AUTHORS: Zihao Chen ; Hisashi Handa ; Kimiaki Shirahama
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite this prevalence, most studies have focused exclusively on English and few concern domain adaptation for domain-specific downstream tasks, especially for low-resource languages like Japanese, which are characterized by insufficient target domain data and the lack of a proper training strategy. To overcome this, we propose a novel Japanese sentence representation framework, JCSE (derived from ``Contrastive learning of Sentence Embeddings for Japanese''), that creates training data by generating sentences and synthesizing them with sentences available in a target domain.

AUTHORS: Conghao Xiong ; Hao Chen ; Joseph Sung ; Irwin King
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]

To resolve this issue, we propose the Hierarchical Attention-Guided Multiple Instance Learning framework to fully exploit the WSIs, which can dynamically and attentively discover the discriminative regions across multiple resolutions of the WSIs.

AUTHORS: Abhijit Suprem ; Joao Eduardo Ferreira ; Calton Pu
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.CY, cs.SI]
HIGHLIGHT: By design, misinformation evades retrospective classifiers by exploiting two properties we call new-normal: (1) never-seen-before novelty that cause inescapable generalization challenges for previous classifiers, and (2) massive but short campaigns that end before they can be manually annotated for new classifier training. To tackle these challenges, we propose UFIT, which combines two techniques: semantic masking of strong signal keywords to reduce overfitting, and intra-proxy smoothness regularization of high-density regions in the latent space to improve reliability and maintain accuracy.
