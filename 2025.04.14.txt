AUTHORS: HUU-LOC TRAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]

161, TITLE: LoRAX: LoRA EXpandable Networks for Continual Synthetic Image Attribution
AUTHORS: Danielle Sullivan-Pao ; Nicole Tian ; Pooya Khorrami
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, attribution models struggle to generalize to unseen models, and traditional fine-tuning methods for updating these models have shown to be impractical in real-world settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoRA eXpandable Networks (LoRAX), a parameter-efficient class incremental algorithm that adapts to novel generative image models without the need for full retraining.

162, TITLE: Hypergraph Vision Transformers: Images Are More Than Nodes, More Than Edges
AUTHORS: Joshua Fixelle
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer an alternative by leveraging graph-based methodologies but are hindered by the computational bottlenecks of clustering algorithms used for edge generation. To address these issues, we propose the Hypergraph Vision Transformer (HgVT), which incorporates a hierarchical bipartite hypergraph structure into the vision transformer framework to capture higher-order semantic relationships while maintaining computational efficiency.

163, TITLE: Steering CLIP's Vision Transformer with Sparse Autoencoders
AUTHORS: SONIA JOSEPH et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While vision models are highly capable, their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood -- a challenge which sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have helped address in language, but which remains underexplored in vision. We address this gap by training SAEs on CLIP's vision transformer and uncover key differences between vision and language processing, including distinct sparsity patterns for SAEs trained across layers and token types.
