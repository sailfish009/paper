AUTHORS: Bao Tang; Shuai Zhang; Yueting Zhu; Jijun Xiang; Xin Yang; Li Yu; Wenyu Liu; Xinggang Wang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Nevertheless, current continuous-time consistency distillation methods still rely heavily on training data and computational resources, hindering their deployment in resource-constrained scenarios and limiting their scalability to diverse domains. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory-Backward Consistency Model (TBCM), which eliminates the dependence on external training data by extracting latent representations directly from the teacher model's generation trajectory.

AUTHORS: Kwok Lung Fan; Yee Lam Elim Thompson; Weijie Chen; Craig K. Abbey; Frank W. Samuelson

AUTHORS: Qiyao Wei; Edward Morrell; Lea Goetz; Mihaela van der Schaar
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations.

9, TITLE: Intelligent Image Search Algorithms Fusing Visual Large Models
AUTHORS: Kehan Wang; Tingqiong Cui; Yang Zhang; Yu Chen; Shifeng Wu; Zhenzhang Li
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, conventional methods face significant limitations: manual features (e.g., SIFT) lack robustness; deep learning-based detectors (e.g., YOLO) can identify component presence but cannot perform state-specific retrieval or zero-shot search; Visual Large Models (VLMs) offer semantic and zero-shot capabilities but suffer from poor spatial grounding and high computational cost, making them inefficient for direct retrieval. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes DetVLM, a novel intelligent image search framework that synergistically fuses object detection with VLMs.

To address these challenges, inspired by recent advances in tool-integrated reasoning, we propose Agent0-VL, a self-evolving vision-language agent that achieves continual improvement with tool-integrated reasoning.

17, TITLE: DiFR: Inference Verification Despite Nondeterminism
AUTHORS: Adam Karvonen; Daniel Reuter; Roy Rinberg; Luke Marks; Adrià Garriga-Alonso; Keri Warr
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, re-running the same inference process twice often leads to different results due to benign numerical noise, making it difficult to distinguish legitimate variation from actual problems. To address this problem, we introduce Token-DiFR (Token-Divergence-From-Reference), a method for verifying inference outputs by comparing generated tokens against predictions made by a trusted reference implementation conditioned on the same random seed.

18, TITLE: The Image As Its Own Reward: Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Reward for Image Generation
AUTHORS: Weijia Mao; Hao Chen; Zhenheng Yang; Mike Zheng Shou
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]

To address this, we introduce Adv-GRPO, an RL framework with an adversarial reward that iteratively updates both the reward model and the generator.

21, TITLE: SSA: Sparse Sparse Attention By Aligning Full and Sparse Attention Outputs in Feature Space
AUTHORS: Zhenyi Shen; Junru Lu; Lin Gui; Jiazheng Li; Yulan He; Di Yin; Xing Sun
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer.

22, TITLE: LocateAnything3D: Vision-Language 3D Detection with Chain-of-Sight

AUTHORS: Andrew S. Cassidy; Guillaume Garreau; Jay Sivagnaname; Mike Grassi; Bernard Brezzo; John V. Arthur; Dharmendra S. Modha
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We show for invertible problems that transform data from a source domain (for example, Logic Condition Tables (LCTs)) to a destination domain (for example, Hardware Description Language (HDL) code), an approach of using Large Language Models (LLMs) as a lossless encoder from source to destination followed by as a lossless decoder back to the source, comparable to lossless compression in information theory, can mitigate most of the LLM drawbacks of hallucinations and omissions.

AUTHORS: Zhiqing Guo; Dongdong Xi; Songlin Li; Gaobo Yang

HIGHLIGHT: Existing fully-supervised IML methods depend heavily on dense pixel-level mask annotations, which limits scalability to large datasets or real-world deployment.In contrast, the majority of existing weakly-supervised IML approaches are based on image-level labels, which greatly reduce annotation effort but typically lack precise spatial localization. To address this dilemma, we propose BoxPromptIML, a novel weakly-supervised IML framework that effectively balances annotation cost and localization performance.

To overcome this, we propose CrossEarth-Gate, which introduces two primary contributions. First, we establish a comprehensive RS module toolbox to address multifaceted domain gaps, comprising spatial, semantic, and frequency modules.

141, TITLE: ST-PPO: Stabilized Off-Policy Proximal Policy Optimization for Multi-Turn Agents Training
AUTHORS: Chenliang Li; Adel Elmahdy; Alex Boyd; Zhongruo Wang; Alfredo Garcia; Parminder Bhatia; Taha Kass-Hout; Cao Xiao; Mingyi Hong
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples.

AUTHORS: Davy Zeng; Alexis Luglio; Daniel W. Liao; Younggyu Kim; Tae H. Cho; Neil P. Dasgupta
CATEGORY: ECS Meeting Abstracts [ECS MEETING ABSTRACTS]
HIGHLIGHT: While significant efforts have been devoted to improving the uniformity of lithium plating in LIBs by modifying the current collector using patterned interlayers and 3D geometries [1,2], it is unclear if these techniques are directly translatable to solid-state batteries due to the uniquely complex chemo-mechanics of the solid-solid interface. Therefore, in this study we explore the use of patterned ALD deposited interlayers to control in situ lithium metal formation at the current collector and argyrodite (Li 6 PS 5 Cl) solid electrolyte interface.

156, TITLE: Modality-Balanced Collaborative Distillation for Multi-Modal Domain Generalization
AUTHORS: Xiaohan Wang; Zhangtao Cheng; Ting Zhong; Leiting Chen; Fan Zhou
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, applying WA directly to multi-modal domain generalization (MMDG) is challenging: differences in optimization speed across modalities lead WA to overfit to faster-converging ones in early stages, suppressing the contribution of slower yet complementary modalities, thereby hindering effective modality fusion and skewing the loss surface toward sharper, less generalizable minima. To address this issue, we propose MBCD, a unified collaborative distillation framework that retains WA's flatness-inducing advantages while overcoming its shortcomings in multi-modal contexts.

To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework.
