HIGHLIGHT: With the recent success of the diffusion probabilistic model (DPM), we found it is especially suitable for accurate and crisp edge detection since the denoising process is directly applied to the original image size. Therefore, we propose the first diffusion model for the task of general edge detection, which we call DiffusionEdge.

82, TITLE: Spy-Watermark: Robust Invisible Watermarking for Backdoor Attack
AUTHORS: Ruofei Wang ; Renjie Wan ; Zongyu Guo ; Qing Guo ; Rui Huang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Current methods use manual patterns or special perturbations as triggers, while they often overlook the robustness against data corruption, making backdoor attacks easy to defend in practice. To address this issue, we propose a novel backdoor attack method named Spy-Watermark, which remains effective when facing data collapse and backdoor defense.

83, TITLE: Mean-Field Assisted Deep Boltzmann Learning with Probabilistic Computers
AUTHORS: Shuvro Chowdhury ; Shaila Niazi ; Kerem Y. Camsari
CATEGORY: cs.ET [cs.ET, cs.AR, cs.LG, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we show that deep and unrestricted BMs can be trained using p-computers generating hundreds of billions of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples per second, on sparse networks developed originally for use in D-Wave's annealers.

84, TITLE: Disentangle Estimation of Causal Effects from Cross-Silo Data
AUTHORS: YUXUAN LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR, stat.ME]
HIGHLIGHT: This, in turn, can result in biased estimations of local causal effects, which rely on the characteristics of only a subset of the covariates. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an innovative disentangle architecture designed to facilitate the seamless cross-silo transmission of model parameters, enriched with causal mechanisms, through a combination of shared and private branches.

AUTHORS: Pouyan Sajadi ; Mostafa Rahmani Dehaghani ; Yifan Tang ; G. Gary Wang
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Conversely, machine learning models rely heavily on high-quality datasets, which can be costly and challenging to obtain within the metal AM domain. Our work addresses this by introducing a physics-informed neural network framework specifically designed for temperature field prediction in metal AM.

AUTHORS: MINCONG HUANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.DC]
HIGHLIGHT: However, it suffers from imbalanced memory consumption, leading to insufficient memory utilization. The BPipe technique was proposed to address this issue and has proven effective in the GPT-3 model.

91, TITLE: Universal Approximation Theorem for Vector- and Hypercomplex-Valued Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Marcos Eduardo Valle ; Wington L. Vital ; Guilherme Vieira
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper extends the universal approximation theorem for a wide range of vector-valued neural networks, including hypercomplex-valued models as particular instances. Precisely, we introduce the concept of non-degenerate algebra and state the universal approximation theorem for neural networks defined on such algebras.

92, TITLE: K-Winners-Take-All Ensemble Neural Network
AUTHORS: Abien Fred Agarap ; Arnulfo P. Azcarraga
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: It then uses a gating network that assigns a specialization to each of its sub-networks called "experts". We improve on these aforementioned ways for combining a group of neural networks by using a k-Winners-Take-All (kWTA) activation function, that acts as the combination method for the outputs of each sub-network in the ensemble.

93, TITLE: Unit Testing in ASP Revisited: Language and Test-Driven Development Environment

AUTHORS: Gleb Pogudin
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC, math.AG]
HIGHLIGHT: For removing these components, J.M. Rojas proposed to take the greatest common divisor of the results of two different perturbations. In this paper, we investigate this construction, and show that the extra components persistent under taking different perturbations must come either from singularities or from positive-dimensional fibers.
