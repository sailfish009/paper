243, TITLE: Unified Kernel-Segregated Transpose Convolution Operation
AUTHORS: VIJAY SRINIVAS TIDA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, kernel segregation has disadvantages, such as computing extra elements to obtain the output feature map with odd dimensions while launching a thread. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a unified kernel segregation approach that limits the usage of memory and computational resources by employing one unified kernel to execute four sub-kernels.

244, TITLE: Revisiting Kernel Attention with Correlated Gaussian Process Representation
AUTHORS: Long Minh Bui ; Tho Tran Huu ; Duy Dinh ; Tan Minh Nguyen ; Trong Nghia Hoang
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, such approaches have to confine the transformers to the space of symmetric attention to ensure the necessary symmetric requirement of their GP's kernel specification, which reduces the representation capacity of the model. To mitigate this restriction, we propose the Correlated Gaussian Process Transformer (CGPT), a new class of transformers whose self-attention units are modeled as cross-covariance between two correlated GPs (CGPs).
