CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Although simpler and computationally efficient pretraining objectives, e.g., predicting the first character of a masked token, have recently shown comparable results to MLM, no objectives with a masking scheme actually outperform it in downstream tasks. Motivated by the assumption that their lack of complexity plays a vital role in the degradation, we validate whether more complex masked objectives can achieve better results and investigate how much complexity they should have to perform comparably to MLM.

To address this limitation, we propose QA4RE, a framework that aligns RE with question answering (QA), a predominant task in instruction-tuning datasets.
