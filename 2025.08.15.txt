CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Whilerecent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress inspecialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. Thispaper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largelyattributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed byrule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significantimprovements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leadingproprietary models.

In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybridquantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selectscritical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepanciesbefore and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.This means we better compensate for quantization errors during theirpropagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur.

229, TITLE: Nested-ReFT: Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Model Fine-Tuning Via Off-Policy Rollouts
AUTHORS: Maxime Heuillet ; Yufei Cui ; Boxing Chen ; Audrey Durand ; Prasanna Parthasarathi
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Instandard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions withanswers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performanceimprovements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost ofgenerating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes thetraining cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policyRL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbedNested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behaviormodel to generate off-policy completions during training.
