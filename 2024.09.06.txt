AUTHORS: Xi Chen ; Haosen Yang ; Sheng Jin ; Xiatian Zhu ; Hongxun Yao
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach, FrozenSeg, designed to integrate spatial knowledge from a localization foundation model (e.g., SAM) and semantic knowledge extracted from a ViL model (e.g., CLIP), in a synergistic framework.

80, TITLE: Bypassing DARCY Defense: Indistinguishable Universal Adversarial Triggers

Unfortunately, we find a new UAT generation method, called IndisUAT, which produces triggers (i.e., tokens) and uses them to craft adversarial examples whose feature distribution is indistinguishable from that of the benign examples in a randomly-chosen category at the detection layer of DARCY.

84, TITLE: Make Graph-based Referring Expression Comprehension Great Again Through Expression-guided Dynamic Gating and Regression
AUTHORS: JINGCHENG KE et. al.

To address these issues, we introduce a plug-and-adapt module guided by sub-expressions, called dynamic gate constraint (DGC), which can adaptively disable irrelevant proposals and their connections in graphs during reasoning.
