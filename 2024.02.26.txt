HIGHLIGHT: This article presents a thorough review of music representation, feature analysis, heuristic algorithms, statistical and parametric modelling, and human and automatic evaluation measures, along with a discussion of which approaches and models seem most suitable for live interaction.

HIGHLIGHT: However, many algorithms proposed in the neuroevolutive literature are either too unreliable or limited to a small, predefined region of the hyperparameter space. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose the Chimera Algorithm, a novel, hybrid neuroevolutive algorithm that integrates the Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm with Evolutionary Computation tools to generate models from scratch, as well as to refine a given previous architecture to better fit the task at hand.

157, TITLE: Towards Spatially-Lucid AI Classification in Non-Euclidean Space: An Application for MxIF Oncology Data
AUTHORS: MAJID FARHADLOO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Given multi-category point sets from different place-types, our goal is to develop a spatially-lucid classifier that can distinguish between two classes based on the arrangements of their points.
