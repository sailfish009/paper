AUTHORS: Rami Zewail
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: Learning robust representations for biosignals is often hampered by thechallenge of designing effective data augmentations.Traditional methods canfail to capture the complex variations inherent in physiological data. Withinthis context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-AugmentedContrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models andsupervised contrastive learning.

242, TITLE: Towards Self-Supervised Foundation Models for Critical Care Time Series
AUTHORS: Katja Naasunnguaq Jagd ; Rachael DeVries ; Ole Winther
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Domain-specific foundation models for healthcare have expanded rapidly inrecent years, yet foundation models for critical care time series remainrelatively underexplored due to the limited size and availability of datasets.In this work, we introduce an early-stage pre-trained foundation model forcritical care time-series based on the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), trained onpooled electronic health record datasets.

243, TITLE: Exploration with Foundation Models: Capabilities, Limitations, and Hybrid Approaches
AUTHORS: Remo Sasso ; Michelangelo Conserva ; Dominik Jeurissen ; Paulo Rauber
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, 68T05, I.2.6; I.2.8]
HIGHLIGHT: Ourinvestigation reveals a key limitation: while VLMs can infer high-levelobjectives from visual input, they consistently fail at precise low-levelcontrol: the "knowing-doing gap". To analyze a potential bridge for this gap,we investigate a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled, best-casescenario.

AUTHORS: Charles Dansereau ; Junior-Samuel Lopez-Yepez ; Karthik Soma ; Antoine Fagette
CATEGORY: cs.MA [cs.MA, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In MARL and single-agent RL, standardized environments such as ALE andSMAC have allowed to establish recognized benchmarks to measure progress.However, there is a clear lack of such standardized testbed for cooperativeHeMARL. As a result, new research in this field often uses simple environments,where most algorithms perform near optimally, or uses weakly heterogeneous MARLenvironments.

AUTHORS: Kohsuke Kubota ; Shonosuke Sugasawa
CATEGORY: stat.ME [stat.ME, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Althoughregression discontinuity design is a standard method for such causal inferencetasks, its assumptions can be violated when customers, aware of the thresholds,strategically manipulate their spending to qualify for the rewards. To addressthis issue, we propose a novel framework for estimating the causal effect underthreshold manipulation.
