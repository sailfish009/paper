AUTHORS: Ishan Khatri ; Kyle Vedder ; Neehar Peri ; Deva Ramanan ; James Hays
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Current scene flow methods broadly fail to describe motion on small objects, and current scene flow evaluation protocols hide this failure by averaging over many points, with most drawn larger objects. To fix this evaluation failure, we propose a new evaluation protocol, Bucket Normalized EPE, which is class-aware and speed-normalized, enabling contextualized error comparisons between object types that move at vastly different speeds.

To investigate this possibility, we conduct thorough empirical studies both in simulation and on a real robot that compare data collection strategies and assess whether visual imitation learning policies can compose environmental factors.

HIGHLIGHT: While the problem of recognizing balanceable graphs was conjectured to be NP-complete by Dailly, Hansberg, and Ventura in 2021, balanceable graphs admit an elegant combinatorial characterization: a graph is balanceable if and only there exist two vertex subsets, one containing half of all the graph's edges and another one such that the corresponding cut contains half of all the graph's edges. We consider a special case of this property, namely when one of the two sets is a vertex cover, and call the corresponding graphs simply balanceable.

AUTHORS: Jiayan Cao ; Xueyu Zhu ; Cheng Qian
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Lane detection plays a critical role in the field of autonomous driving. Prevailing methods generally adopt basic concepts (anchors, key points, etc.) from object detection and segmentation tasks, while these approaches require manual adjustments for curved objects, involve exhaustive searches on predefined anchors, require complex post-processing steps, and may lack flexibility when applied to real-world scenarios.In this paper, we propose a novel approach, LanePtrNet, which treats lane detection as a process of point voting and grouping on ordered sets: Our method takes backbone features as input and predicts a curve-aware centerness, which represents each lane as a point and assigns the most probable center point to it.
