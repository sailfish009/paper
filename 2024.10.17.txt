32, TITLE: CMAL: A Novel Cross-Modal Associative Learning Framework for Vision-Language Pre-Training
AUTHORS: Zhiyuan Ma ; Jianjun Li ; Guohui Li ; Kaiyan Huang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, most of recent studies focus on cross-modal contrastive learning (CMCL) to promote image-text alignment by pulling embeddings of positive sample pairs together while pushing those of negative pairs apart, which ignores the natural asymmetry property between different modalities and requires large-scale image-text corpus to achieve arduous progress. To mitigate this predicament, we propose CMAL, a Cross-Modal Associative Learning framework with anchor points detection and cross-modal associative learning for VLP.

AUTHORS: Zhiyuan Zhao ; Hengrui Kang ; Bin Wang ; Conghui He
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Document Layout Analysis is crucial for real-world document understanding systems, but it encounters a challenging trade-off between speed and accuracy: multimodal methods leveraging both text and visual features achieve higher accuracy but suffer from significant latency, whereas unimodal methods relying solely on visual features offer faster processing speeds at the expense of accuracy. To address this dilemma, we introduce DocLayout-YOLO, a novel approach that enhances accuracy while maintaining speed advantages through document-specific optimizations in both pre-training and model design.

55, TITLE: MC-Bench: A Benchmark for Multi-Context Visual Grounding in The Era of MLLMs
AUTHORS: Yunqiu Xu ; Linchao Zhu ; Yi Yang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary vision-language understanding capabilities and shown potential to serve as general-purpose assistants, their abilities to solve instance-level visual-language problems beyond a single image warrant further exploration. In order to assess these unproven abilities of MLLMs, this paper proposes a new visual grounding task called multi-context visual grounding, which aims to localize instances of interest across multiple images based on open-ended text prompts.

HIGHLIGHT: As constraints in complex instructions are diverse and vary widely, manually crafting few-shot examples for each constraint type can be labor-intensive and sub-optimal. To deal with these two challenges, we propose the Divide-Verify-Refine (DVR) framework with three steps: (1) Divide complex instructions into single constraints and prepare appropriate tools; (2) Verify: To address the feedback quality problem, these tools will rigorously verify responses and provide reliable feedback; (3) Refine: To address the constraint diversity challenge, we design a refinement repository that collects successful refinement processes and uses them as few-shot demonstrations for future cases, allowing LLMs to learn from the past experience during inference.

CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Current RGB-Thermal Video Object Detection (RGBT VOD) methods still depend on manually aligning data at the image level, which hampers its practical application in real-world scenarios since image pairs captured by multispectral sensors often differ in both fields of view and resolution. To address this limitation, we propose a Multi-modal Dynamic Local fusion Network (MDLNet) designed to handle unaligned RGBT image pairs.

CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, in this paper, we find that there naturally exists a gap, which resembles the modality gap, between the prototype and image instance embeddings extracted from the frozen pre-trained backbone, and simply applying the same transformation during the adaptation phase constrains exploring the optimal representations and shrinks the gap between prototype and image representations. To solve this problem, we propose a simple yet effective method, contrastive prototype-image adaptation (CoPA), to adapt different transformations respectively for prototypes and images similarly to CLIP by treating prototypes as text prompts.

225, TITLE: Rethinking Visual Counterfactual Explanations Through Region Constraint
AUTHORS: Bartlomiej Sobieski ; Jakub Grzywaczewski ; Bartlomiej Sadlej ; Matthew Tivnan ; Przemyslaw Biecek
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: To address the issue of previous methods, which modify images in a very entangled and widely dispersed manner, we propose region-constrained VCEs (RVCEs), which assume that only a predefined image region can be modified to influence the model's prediction. To effectively sample from this subclass of VCEs, we propose Region-Constrained Counterfactual Schr\"odinger Bridges (RCSB), an adaptation of a tractable subclass of Schr\"odinger Bridges to the problem of conditional inpainting, where the conditioning signal originates from the classifier of interest.

239, TITLE: Facing Identity: The Formation and Performance of Identity Via Face-Based Artificial Intelligence Technologies
AUTHORS: Wells Lucas Santo
CATEGORY: cs.CY [cs.CY, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Drawing from previous frameworks of identity play in the digital, as well as trans practices that have historically played with or transgressed the boundaries of identity classification, we can develop concepts adequate for analyzing digital faciality and identity given the current landscape of post-facial artificial intelligence technologies that allow users to interface with the digital in an entirely novel manner. To ground this framework of transgression, I conclude by proposing an interview study with VTubers -- online streamers who perform using motion-captured avatars instead of their real-life faces -- to gain qualitative insight on how these sociotechnical experiences.
