We study this problem in the model of catalytic computation: space-boundedmachines are granted access to \textit{catalytic space}, which is additionalworking memory that is full with arbitrary data that must be preserved at theend of its computation.

342, TITLE: S-LAM3D: Segmentation-Guided Monocular 3D Object Detection Via Feature Space Fusion
AUTHORS: Diana-Alexandra Sas ; Florin Oniga
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision taskdue to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in anydepth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by usingConvolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as featureextraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parametersprediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injectingprecomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into thefeature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection modelor jointly learning the priors.

HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we address the challengeof object-to-object affordance grounding under limited data contraints.Inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning with 2D vision foundationmodels, we propose a novel one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance learningapproach for robotic manipulation.

379, TITLE: Combining TSL and LLM to Automate REST API Testing: A Comparative Study
AUTHORS: Thiago Barradas ; Aline Paes ; V�nia de Oliveira Neves
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Exhaustive testing of all input combinations isimpractical, often resulting in undetected failures, high manual effort, andlimited test coverage. To address these issues, we introduce RestTSLLM, anapproach that uses Test Specification Language (TSL) in conjunction with LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of test cases for REST APIs.The approach targets two core challenges: the creation of test scenarios andthe definition of appropriate input data.
