20, TITLE: AdapEdit: Spatio-Temporal Guided Adaptive Editing Algorithm for Text-Based Continuity-Sensitive Image Editing
AUTHORS: Zhiyuan Ma ; Guoli Jia ; Bowen Zhou
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, previous works mainly focus on discreteness-sensitive instructions such as adding, removing or replacing specific objects, background elements or global styles (i.e., hard editing), while generally ignoring subject-binding but semantically fine-changing continuity-sensitive instructions such as actions, poses or adjectives, and so on (i.e., soft editing), which hampers generative AI from generating user-customized visual contents. To mitigate this predicament, we propose a spatio-temporal guided adaptive editing algorithm AdapEdit, which realizes adaptive image editing by introducing a soft-attention strategy to dynamically vary the guiding degree from the editing conditions to visual pixels from both temporal and spatial perspectives.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Spatial Knowledge-Infused Hierarchical Learning (SKI-HL) framework that iteratively infers sample labels within a multi-resolution hierarchy.

In this paper, we strive to bridge this gap by undertaking a comprehensive exploration of these inherent properties, to boost the performance of current anti-customization approaches.

161, TITLE: A Hybrid Analysis of LBSN Data to Early Detect Anomalies in Crowd Dynamics
AUTHORS: Rebeca P. D�az-Redondo ; Carlos Garcia-Rubio ; Ana Fern�ndez Vilas ; Celeste Campo ; Alicia Rodriguez-Carrion
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Therefore, unexpected behaviors in the social media activity are a trustful evidence of unexpected changes of the activity in the city. In this paper we introduce a hybrid solution to early detect these changes based on applying a combination of two approaches, the use of entropy analysis and clustering techniques, on the data gathered from LBSNs.

162, TITLE: Brain-optimized Inference Improves Reconstructions of FMRI Brain Activity
AUTHORS: Reese Kneeland ; Jordyn Ojeda ; Ghislain St-Yves ; Thomas Naselaris
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: At each iteration, we sample a small library of images from an image distribution (a diffusion model) conditioned on a seed reconstruction from the previous iteration. We select those that best approximate the measured brain activity when passed through our encoding model, and use these images for structural guidance during the generation of the small library in the next iteration.

165, TITLE: Robust MRI Reconstruction By Smoothed Unrolling (SMUG)
AUTHORS: SHIJUN LIANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: This raises the question of how to devise DL techniques for MRI reconstruction that can be robust to train-test variations. To address this problem, we propose a novel image reconstruction framework, termed Smoothed Unrolling (SMUG), which advances a deep unrolling-based MRI reconstruction model using a randomized smoothing (RS)-based robust learning approach.

AUTHORS: Alhassan Mabrouk ; Rebeca P. D�az Redondo ; Abdelghani Dahou ; Mohamed Abd Elaziz ; Mohammed Kayed
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Thus, the existing methods for predicting pneumonia cannot attain substantial levels of accuracy. Therefore, this paper presents a computer-aided classification of pneumonia, coined as Ensemble Learning (EL), to simplify the diagnosis process on chest X-ray images.

167, TITLE: Universal Adversarial Framework to Improve Adversarial Robustness for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
AUTHORS: Samrat Mukherjee ; Dibyanayan Bandyopadhyay ; Baban Gain ; Asif Ekbal
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Since healthcare has always been an extremely important domain demanding error-free performance, any adversaries could pose a big threat to the applicability of such systems. In this work, we use Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) to quantify the vulnerability of Medical Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for detecting DR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first attempt that works on attacking complete fine-grained classification of DR images using various UAPs.

In this study, we propose a versatile multi-task neural network framework, based on an enhanced Transformer U-Net architecture, capable of simultaneously, selectively, and adaptively addressing these medical image tasks.
