305, TITLE: Residual Connection Networks in Medical Image Processing: Exploration of ResUnet++ Model Driven By Human Computer Interaction
AUTHORS: Peixin Dai ; Jingsi Zhang ; Zhitao Shu
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces ResUnet++, an advanced hybrid model combining ResNet and Unet++, designed to improve tumour detection and localisation while fostering seamless interaction between clinicians and medical imaging systems.

306, TITLE: Fine-Tuning TransMorph with Gradient Correlation for Anatomical Alignment
AUTHORS: Lukas Fï¿½rner ; Kartikay Tehlan ; Thomas Wendler
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: For the Learn2Reg2024 LUMIR challenge, we propose fine-tuning of the pre-trained TransMorph model to improve the convergence stability as well as the deformation smoothness.

307, TITLE: Enhancing Transfer Learning for Medical Image Classification with SMOTE: A Comparative Study
AUTHORS: Md. Zehan Alam ; Tonmoy Roy ; H. M. Nahid Kawsar ; Iffat Rimi
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, performance in diabetic retinopathy detection is hindered by class imbalance. To mitigate this, we integrate the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) with TL and traditional machine learning(ML) methods, which improves accuracy by 1.97%, recall (sensitivity) by 5.43%, and specificity by 0.72%.

308, TITLE: Segmentation of Muscularis Propria in Colon Histopathology Images Using Vision Transformers for Hirschsprung's Disease
AUTHORS: Youssef Megahed ; Anthony Fuller ; Saleh Abou-Alwan ; Dina El Demellawy ; Adrian D. C. Chan
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This study explores the application of ViTs for muscularis propria segmentation in calretinin-stained histopathology images and compares their performance to CNNs and shallow learning methods.
