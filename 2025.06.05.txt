1, TITLE: Stronger Baselines for Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Long-Context Language Models
AUTHORS: Alex Laitenberger ; Christopher D. Manning ; Nelson F. Liu
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: With the rise of long-context language models (LMs) capable of processing tens of thousands of tokens in a single pass, do multi-stage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines still offer measurable benefits over simpler, single-stage approaches? To assess this question, we conduct a controlled evaluation for QA tasks under systematically scaled token budgets, comparing two recent multi-stage pipelines, ReadAgent and RAPTOR, against three baselines, including DOS RAG (Document's Original Structure RAG), a simple retrieve-then-read method that preserves original passage order.

AUTHORS: TIM FRANZMEYER et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]

6, TITLE: Images Are Worth Variable Length of Representations
AUTHORS: Lingjun Mao ; Rodolfo Corona ; Xin Liang ; Wenhao Yan ; Zineng Tang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: For example, a visually complex image (e.g., a cluttered room) inherently carries more information and thus deserves more tokens than a simple image (e.g., a blank wall). To address this inefficiency, we propose DOVE, a dynamic vision encoder that produces a variable number of visual tokens (i.e., continuous representation vectors) to reconstruct each image.

7, TITLE: Seed-Coder: Let The Code Model Curate Data for Itself
AUTHORS: YUYU ZHANG et. al.

17, TITLE: Language-Image Alignment with Fixed Text Encoders
AUTHORS: Jingfeng Yang ; Ziyang Wu ; Yue Zhao ; Yi Ma
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Currently, the most dominant approach to establishing language-image alignment is to pre-train text and image encoders jointly through contrastive learning, such as CLIP and its variants. In this work, we question whether such a costly joint training is necessary.

18, TITLE: DenseDPO: Fine-Grained Temporal Preference Optimization for Video Diffusion Models
AUTHORS: ZIYI WU et. al.

In this work, we introduce DenseDPO, a method that addresses these shortcomings by making three contributions. First, we create each video pair for DPO by denoising corrupted copies of a ground truth video.

HIGHLIGHT: For instance, if trained on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions "safe," VLMs may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as "safe." We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\textit{visual stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions.

To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios.

35, TITLE: The Harmonic Structure of Information Contours
AUTHORS: ELEFTHERIA TSIPIDI et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: This has been linked to dataset biases and the use of sentence-level labels, which fail to teach models the underlying structure of hate speech. In this work, we show that even when models are trained with more fine-grained, span-level annotations (e.g., "artists" is labeled as target and "are parasites" as dehumanising comparison), they struggle to disentangle the meaning of these labels from the surrounding context.

42, TITLE: ConsistentChat: Building Skeleton-Guided Consistent Dialogues for Large Language Models from Scratch
AUTHORS: JIAWEI CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]

AUTHORS: Walter Mayor ; Johan Obando-Ceron ; Aaron Courville ; Pablo Samuel Castro
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: The manner in which data is collected in these algorithms, controlled via the number of parallel environments and the rollout length, induces a form of bias-variance trade-off; the number of training passes over the collected data, on the other hand, must strike a balance between sample efficiency and overfitting. We conduct an empirical analysis of these trade-offs on PPO, one of the most popular RL algorithms that uses parallel actors, and establish connections to network plasticity and, more generally, optimization stability.
