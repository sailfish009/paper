1, TITLE: ReTool: Reinforcement Learning for Strategic Tool Use in LLMs
AUTHORS: JIAZHAN FENG et. al.

To bridge this gap, we propose ReTool, which enhances long-form reasoning with tool-integrated learning, including two key features: (1) dynamic interleaving of real-time code execution within natural language reasoning processes, and (2) an automated RL paradigm that allows policy rollouts with multi-turn real-time code execution and teaches the model in learning when and how to invoke tools based on outcome feedback.
