AUTHORS: Ryan Soh-Eun Shim ; Kalvin Chang ; David R. Mortensen
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Received wisdom in linguistic typology holds that if the structure of a language becomes more complex in one dimension, it will simplify in another, building on the assumption that all languages are equally complex (Joseph and Newmeyer, 2012). We study this claim on a micro-level, using a tightly-controlled sample of Dutch dialects (across 366 collection sites) and Min dialects (across 60 sites), which enables a more fair comparison across varieties.
