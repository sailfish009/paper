To address these challenges, we propose a stratified granular comparison network.

75, TITLE: A General Purpose Spectral Foundational Model for Both Proximal and Remote Sensing Spectral Imaging
AUTHORS: William Michael Laprade ; Jesper Cairo Westergaard ; Svend Christensen ; Mads Nielsen ; Anders Bjorholm Dahl
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The few spectral foundation models that do exist usually have one of two limitations: (1) they are built and trained only on remote sensing data limiting their application in proximal spectral imaging, (2) they utilize the more widely available multispectral imaging datasets with less than 15 channels restricting their use with hundred-channel hyperspectral images. To alleviate these issues, we propose a large-scale foundational model and dataset built upon the masked autoencoder architecture that takes advantage of spectral channel encoding, spatial-spectral masking and ImageNet pretraining for an adaptable and robust model for downstream spectral imaging tasks.
