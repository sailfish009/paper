AUTHORS: Daniel Nahmias ; Gal Engelberg ; Dan Klein ; Asaf Shabtai
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.CR, I.2.7]
HIGHLIGHT: Spear-phishing attacks present a significant security challenge, with large language models (LLMs) escalating the threat by generating convincing emails and facilitating target reconnaissance. To address this, we propose a detection approach based on a novel document vectorization method that utilizes an ensemble of LLMs to create representation vectors.

HIGHLIGHT: To generate phenotypes, we provide a unique technique for removing semantically ineffective code from GP trees.

169, TITLE: Human Curriculum Effects Emerge with In-Context Learning in Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Jacob Russin ; Ellie Pavlick ; Michael J. Frank
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.LG, q-bio.NC]
HIGHLIGHT: In tasks governed by succinct rules, learning is more robust when related examples are blocked across trials, but in the absence of such rules, interleaving is more effective. To date, no neural model has simultaneously captured these seemingly contradictory effects.

174, TITLE: Rethinking U-net Skip Connections for Biomedical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: FRAUKE WILM et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Previous works showed that the trained network layers differ in their susceptibility to this domain shift, e.g., shallow layers are more affected than deeper layers. In this work, we investigate the implications of this observation of layer sensitivity to domain shifts of U-net-style segmentation networks.
