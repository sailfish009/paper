AUTHORS: Yiming Yang; Hong Yang; Hongqiang Li; Yifei Zhou; Yinhao Huang; Zhiqiang Wang
CATEGORY: Frontiers in Earth Science [FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE]

2, TITLE: LLM-VA: Resolving The Jailbreak-Overrefusal Trade-off Via Vector Alignment
AUTHORS: Haonan Zhang; Dongxia Wang; Yi Liu; Kexin Chen; Wenhai Wang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes.

5, TITLE: Quantum Circuit Pre-Synthesis: Learning Local Edits to Reduce $T$-count
AUTHORS: Daniele Lizzio Bosco; Lukasz Cincio; Giuseppe Serra; M. Cerezo
CATEGORY: arxiv-quant-ph [ARXIV-QUANT-PH]
HIGHLIGHT: However, composing local methods leads to suboptimal compilations in key metrics such as $T$-count or circuit depth, and their performance strongly depends on circuit representation. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing \textsc{Q-PreSyn}, a strategy that, given a set of local edits preserving circuit equivalence, uses a RL agent to identify effective sequences of such actions and thereby obtain circuit representations that yield a reduced $T$-count upon synthesis.

AUTHORS: Weicong Liu; Zixuan Yang; Yibo Zhao; Xiang Li
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL.

AUTHORS: Quy-Anh Dang; Chris Ngo
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment.

HIGHLIGHT: Moreover, current methods often handle failures via costly global regeneration due to the difficulty of localising the responsible span or step from prover diagnostics. Aiming to address these problems, we propose a decompose-and-formalise framework that (i) decomposes premise-hypothesis pairs into an entailment tree of atomic steps, (ii) verifies the tree bottom-up to isolate failures to specific nodes, and (iii) performs local diagnostic-guided refinement instead of regenerating the whole explanation.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We argue that predicting downstream performance from validation perplexity suffers from two limitations: averaging token-level losses obscures signal, and no simple parametric family can capture the full spectrum of scaling behaviors. To address this, we propose Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation.

AUTHORS: Zhicheng Zhang; Zhaocheng Du; Jieming Zhu; Jiwei Tang; Fengyuan Lu; Wang Jiaheng; Song-Li Wu; Qianhui Zhu; Jingyu Li; Hai-Tao Zheng; Zhenhua Dong
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While longer sequences provide more context, we observe that increasing the maximum input sequence length in existing CTR models paradoxically degrades performance for short-sequence users due to attention polarization and length imbalance in training data. To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.SE [SE]
HIGHLIGHT: While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches have shown promise by retrieving relevant code snippets as cross-file context, they suffer from two fundamental problems: misalignment between the query and the target code in the retrieval process, and the inability of existing retrieval methods to effectively utilize the inference information.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We attribute this deficiency to a suboptimal training paradigm inherent in prevailing VLMs, which exhibits a text-dominant optimization bias by conceptualizing visual signals merely as passive conditional inputs rather than supervisory targets. To mitigate this, we introduce Youtu-VL, a framework leveraging the Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision (VLUAS) paradigm, which fundamentally shifts the optimization objective from ``vision-as-input'' to ``vision-as-target.''

Based on this view, we introduce HeatACO, a plug-and-play Max-Min Ant System decoder whose transition policy is softly biased by the heatmap while pheromone updates provide lightweight, instance-specific feedback to resolve global conflicts; optional 2-opt/3-opt post-processing further improves tour quality.

153, TITLE: Tracking Drift: Variation-Aware Entropy Scheduling for Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Tongxi Wang; Zhuoyang Xia; Xinran Chen; Shan Liu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We prove that entropy scheduling under non-stationarity can be reduced to a one-dimensional, round-by-round trade-off, faster tracking of the optimal solution after drift vs. avoiding gratuitous randomness when the environment is stable, so exploration strength can be driven by measurable online drift signals. Building on this, we propose AES (Adaptive Entropy Scheduling), which adaptively adjusts the entropy coefficient/temperature online using observable drift proxies during training, requiring almost no structural changes and incurring minimal overhead.

AUTHORS: Nanhan Shen; Zhilei Liu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion.

AUTHORS: Jinming Zhang; Xi Yang; Youpeng Yang; Haosen Shi; Yuyao Yan; Qiufeng Wang; Guangliang Cheng; Kaizhu Huang

HIGHLIGHT: We argue that this instability hinders convergence toward Pareto-optimal solutions and propose a region-wise curriculum strategy that prioritizes learning from certain regions and gradually incorporates uncertain ones, reducing gradient variance. Methodologically, we introduce a Pareto-consistent loss that balances trade-offs between regional uncertainties by adaptively reshaping the loss landscape and constraining convergence dynamics between interior and boundary regions; this guides the model toward Pareto-approximate solutions.

HIGHLIGHT: However, these sources suffer from the sim-to-real visual gap and the human-to-robot embodiment gap, respectively, which limits the policy's generalization to real-world scenarios. In this work, we identify a natural yet underexplored complementarity between these sources: simulation offers the robot action that human data lacks, while human data provides the real-world observation that simulation struggles to render.
