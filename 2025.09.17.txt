Toaddress this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diversesynthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where partdynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model thatpredicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD pointclouds.

AUTHORS: BEIDAN LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidablecomputational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise tomulti-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditionalconstraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterativedesign processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability.While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promisefor autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passiveconstraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing tohandle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To addressthese limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated\textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizesNCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leveragestructured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, whichare dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable codethrough a unified triple-representation scheme.

AUTHORS: Yongjian Tang ; Doruk Tuncel ; Christian Koerner ; Thomas Runkler
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Over-prompting, a phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts lead todiminished performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges theconventional wisdom about in-context few-shot learning. To investigate thisfew-shot dilemma, we outline a prompting framework that leverages threestandard few-shot selection methods - random sampling, semantic embedding, andTF-IDF vectors - and evaluate these methods across multiple LLMs, includingGPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-V3, Gemma-3, LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.2, and Mistral.Our experimental results reveal that incorporating excessive domain-specificexamples into prompts can paradoxically degrade performance in certain LLMs,which contradicts the prior empirical conclusion that more relevant few-shotexamples universally benefit LLMs.

HIGHLIGHT: We introduce GeometricRed-Teaming (GRT), a red-teaming framework that probes robustness throughobject-centric geometric perturbations, automatically generating CrashShapes --structurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that triggercatastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies.

223, TITLE: Unleashing The Power of Discrete-Time State Representation: Ultrafast Target-based IMU-Camera Spatial-Temporal Calibration
AUTHORS: Junlin Song ; Antoine Richard ; Miguel Olivares-Mendez
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To this end, we propose a novel andextremely efficient calibration method that unleashes the power ofdiscrete-time state representation.

224, TITLE: Podcasts As A Medium for Participation in Collective Action: A Case Study of Black Lives Matter
AUTHORS: Theodora Moldovan ; Arianna Pera ; Davide Vega ; Luca Maria Aiello
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.CL, cs.CY]
HIGHLIGHT: We study how participation in collective action is articulated in podcastdiscussions, using the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement as a case study.

225, TITLE: A Pressure-Based Diffusion Model for Influence Maximization on Social Networks
AUTHORS: Curt Stutsman ; Eliot W. Robson ; Abhishek K. Umrawal
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.AI, 05C85, 60J60, 68R05, 68R10, 68T01, 90C35, G.2.1; G.2.2; G.3; H.3.4; H.3.5; I.2.0; J.4]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model -- the PressureThreshold model (PT) -- for dynamically simulating the spread of influencethrough a social network.

226, TITLE: Validating Solidity Code Defects Using Symbolic and Concrete Execution Powered By Large Language Models
AUTHORS: ?tefan-Claudiu Susan ; Andrei Arusoaie ; Dorel Lucanu
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, I.2.2;D.2.5;D.2.4;D.4.6]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces a novel detection pipeline that integratescustom Slither-based detectors, LLMs, Kontrol, and Forge.

227, TITLE: Evaluating Large Language Models for Functional and Maintainable Code in Industrial Settings: A Case Study at ASML
AUTHORS: Yash Mundhra ; Max Valk ; Maliheh Izadi
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a case study conducted in collaboration with theleveling department at ASML to investigate the performance of LLMs ingenerating functional, maintainable code within a closed, highly specializedsoftware environment.

228, TITLE: A Lightweight Pipeline for Noisy Speech Voice Cloning and Accurate Lip Sync Synthesis
AUTHORS: Javeria Amir ; Farwa Attaria ; Mah Jabeen ; Umara Noor ; Zahid Rashid
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Inthis paper, we introduce a new modular pipeline comprising Tortoise text tospeech.

229, TITLE: Reinforcement Learning-Based Market Making As A Stochastic Control on Non-Stationary Limit Order Book Dynamics
AUTHORS: Rafael Zimmer ; Oswaldo Luiz do Valle Costa
CATEGORY: q-fin.TR [q-fin.TR, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper explores the integration of a reinforcement learningagent in a market-making context, where the underlying market dynamics havebeen explicitly modeled to capture observed stylized facts of real markets,including clustered order arrival times, non-stationary spreads and returndrifts, stochastic order quantities and price volatility.

230, TITLE: MEGAN: Mixture of Experts for Robust Uncertainty Estimation in Endoscopy Videos
AUTHORS: DAMOLA AGBELESE et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, all thesemethods often rely on a single expert's annotations as ground truth for modeltraining, overlooking the inter-rater variability in healthcare. To addressthis issue, we propose MEGAN, a Multi-Expert Gating Network that aggregatesuncertainty estimates and predictions from multiple AI experts via EDL modelstrained with diverse ground truths and modeling strategies.
