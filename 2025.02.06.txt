HIGHLIGHT: While some studies directly focus on designing techniques to alleviate the issue, an in-depth investigation of the reasons behind this performance drop has yet to be conducted.To address this gap, we conduct a layer-peeled analysis of model aggregation across various datasets and model architectures. Our findings reveal that the performance drop can be attributed to two major consequences of the aggregation process: (1) it disrupts feature variability suppression in deep neural networks (DNNs), and (2) it weakens the coupling between features and subsequent parameters.Based on these findings, we propose several simple yet effective strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of model aggregation while still enjoying the benefit it brings.
