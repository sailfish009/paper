To address this question, we introduce the Gradient Attribution Property to characterize how reward gradients distribute across policy components, formalized through the Two-Stage Decision-Sampling (DS) Hypothesis, which decomposes the policy into sampling ($?_{sample}$) for generation and decision ($?_{d}$) for verification.

AUTHORS: SYED ABDUL HANNAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Face verification systems have seen substantial advancements; however, they often lack transparency in their decision-making processes. In this paper, we introduce an innovative Vision-Language Model (VLM) for Face Verification, which not only accurately determines if two face images depict the same individual but also explicitly explains the rationale behind its decisions.
