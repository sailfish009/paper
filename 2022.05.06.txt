In this work, we propose attacks against conversational agents that are imperceptible, i.e., they fit the conversation in terms of coherency, relevancy, and fluency, while they are effective and scalable, i.e., they can automatically trigger the system into generating toxic language.

AUTHORS: Sharan Narasimhan ; Suvodip Dey ; Maunendra Sankar Desarkar
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]

We introduce EPAAEs (Embedding Perturbed Adversarial AutoEncoders) which completes this perturbation model, by adding a finely adjustable noise component on the continuous embeddings space.

AUTHORS: Haipeng Sun ; Junwei Bao ; Youzheng Wu ; Xiaodong He
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: A typical end-to-end task-oriented dialog system transfers context into dialog state, and upon which generates a response, which usually faces the problem of error propagation from both previously generated inaccurate dialog states and responses, especially in low-resource scenarios. To alleviate these issues, we propose BORT, a back and denoising reconstruction approach for end-to-end task-oriented dialog system.
