HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we first provide a concise overview of data-driven channel modeling methods, highlighting their limitations. Subsequently, we introduce the concept and advantages of physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based modeling and a summary of recent contributions in this area.

84, TITLE: Do Concept Bottleneck Models Obey Locality?
AUTHORS: Naveen Raman ; Mateo Espinosa Zarlenga ; Juyeon Heo ; Mateja Jamnik
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent work, however, strongly suggests that this assumption may fail to hold in Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), a quintessential family of concept-based interpretable architectures. In this paper, we investigate whether CBMs correctly capture the degree of conditional independence across concepts when such concepts are localised both spatially, by having their values entirely defined by a fixed subset of features, and semantically, by having their values correlated with only a fixed subset of predefined concepts.

85, TITLE: JMA: A General Algorithm to Craft Nearly Optimal Targeted Adversarial Example
AUTHORS: Benedetta Tondi ; Wei Guo ; Mauro Barni
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a more general, theoretically sound, targeted attack that resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced MAhalanobis distance (JMA) term, taking into account the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of the input sample in a given direction.

86, TITLE: Quadratic Time-Frequency Analysis of Vibration Signals for Diagnosing Bearing Faults
AUTHORS: Mohammad Al-Sa'd ; Tuomas Jalonen ; Serkan Kiranyaz ; Moncef Gabbouj
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.SY, eess.SY]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents a fusion of time-frequency analysis and deep learning techniques to diagnose bearing faults under time-varying speeds and varying noise levels.

87, TITLE: Downstream Task-Oriented Generative Model Selections on Synthetic Data Training for Fraud Detection Models
AUTHORS: Yinan Cheng ; Chi-Hua Wang ; Vamsi K. Potluru ; Tucker Balch ; Guang Cheng
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we approach the downstream task-oriented generative model selections problem in the case of training fraud detection models and investigate the best practice given different combinations of model interpretability and model performance constraints.

88, TITLE: Encoding Binary Events from Continuous Time Series in Rooted Trees Using Contrastive Learning
AUTHORS: Tobias Engelhardt Rasmussen ; Siv S�rensen
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.SI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study we propose a contrastive approach for learning a binary event encoder from continuous time series data.

89, TITLE: Explainable Adaptive Tree-based Model Selection for Time Series Forecasting
AUTHORS: Matthias Jakobs ; Amal Saadallah
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This problem becomes even more severe in online-forecasting settings where time series observations are incrementally acquired, and the distributions from which they are drawn may keep changing over time. In this context, we propose a novel method for the online selection of tree-based models using the TreeSHAP explainability method in the task of time series forecasting.

90, TITLE: Spiker+: A Framework for The Generation of Efficient Spiking Neural Networks FPGA Accelerators for Inference at The Edge
AUTHORS: Alessio Carpegna ; Alessandro Savino ; Stefano Di Carlo
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI, cs.AR]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces Spiker+, a comprehensive framework for generating efficient, low-power, and low-area customized Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) accelerators on FPGA for inference at the edge.

91, TITLE: Evolutionary Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Constrained Multi-Objective Optimization with Unknown Constraints
AUTHORS: Shuang Li ; Ke Li ; Wei Li ; Ming Yang
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: However, in certain scenarios, constraint functions might be unknown or inadequately defined, making constraint violation unattainable and potentially misleading for conventional constrained evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms. To address this issue, we present the first of its kind evolutionary optimization framework, inspired by the principles of the alternating direction method of multipliers that decouples objective and constraint functions.

92, TITLE: Profiling Programming Language Learning

CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: We find that many readers drop-out of the book early when faced with difficult language concepts like Rust's ownership types.

AUTHORS: Sanghoon Rho ; Philipp Martens ; Seungcheol Shin ; Yeoneo Kim

94, TITLE: Static Deadlock Detection for Rust Programs
AUTHORS: Yu Zhang ; Kaiwen Zhang ; Guanjun Liu
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.CR, cs.SE]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper proposes a static deadlock detection method tailored for Rust programs, aiming to identify various deadlock types, including double lock, conflict lock, and deadlock associated with conditional variables.
