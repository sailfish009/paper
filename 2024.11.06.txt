161, TITLE: Deriving Nonuniform Lower Bounds from Uniform Nondeterministic Lower Bounds
AUTHORS: Nikolai Chukhin ; Alexander S. Kulikov ; Ivan Mihajlin ; Arina Smirnova
CATEGORY: cs.CC [cs.CC]
HIGHLIGHT: Just recently, it was shown how uniform \emph{lower} bounds can be used to derive nonuniform lower bounds: Belova et al. (SODA 2024) showed that if MAX-3-SAT cannot be solved in co-nondeterministic time $O(2^{(1 - \varepsilon)n})$, then there exists an explicit polynomial family of high arithmetic circuit size; Williams (FOCS 2024) showed that if NSETH is true, then Boolean Inner Product requires large $\text{ETHR} \circ \text{ETHR}$ circuits. In this paper, we continue developing this line of research and show that nondeterministic uniform lower bounds imply nonuniform lower bounds for various types of objects that are notoriously hard to analyze: circuits, matrix rigidity, and tensor rank.

163, TITLE: Advancing Recycling Efficiency: A Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models in Waste Classification
AUTHORS: Zhanshan Qiao
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: With the ongoing increase in the worldwide population and escalating consumption habits,there's a surge in the amount of waste produced.The situation poses considerable challenges for waste management and the optimization of recycling operations.The research tackles the pressing issue of waste classification for recycling by analyzing various deep learning models,including Convolutional Neural Network(CNN),AlexNet,ResNet,ResNet50 plus Support Vector Machine(SVM),and transformers,across a wide array of waste categories.The research meticulously compares these models on several targets like parameters settings,category accuracy,total accuracy and model parameters to establish a uniform evaluation criterion.This research presents a novel method that incorporates SVM with deep learning frameworks,particularly ResNet50.The results indicate the method significantly boosts accuracy in complex waste categories.Moreover,the transformer model outshines others in average accuracy,showcasing its aptitude for intricate classification tasks.To improve performance in poorly performing categories,the research advocates for enlarging the dataset,employing data augmentation,and leveraging sophisticated models such as transformers,along with refining training methodologies.The research paves the way for future advancements in multi-category waste recycling and underscores the pivotal role of deep learning in promoting environmental sustainability.

178, TITLE: Judge Like A Real Doctor: Dual Teacher Sample Consistency Framework for Semi-supervised Medical Image Classification
AUTHORS: ZHANG QIXIANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Just like when diagnosing a case in practice, besides the case itself, the doctor usually refers to certain related trustworthy cases to make more reliable decisions.Therefore, we argue that solely relying on AL-c may ignore the relative differences across samples, which we interpret as relative locations, and only exploit limited information from one perspective. To address this issue, we propose a Sample Consistency Mean Teacher (SCMT) which not only incorporates AL c but also additionally enforces consistency between the samples' relative similarities to its related samples, called Relative Location consistency (RL c).
