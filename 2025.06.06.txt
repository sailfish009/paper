To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point clouds.

84, TITLE: Does Your 3D Encoder Really Work? When Pretrain-SFT from 2D VLMs Meets 3D VLMs
AUTHORS: HAOYUAN LI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Our investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding.

HIGHLIGHT: While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment, which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and temporal information along orthogonal directions.

95, TITLE: Robust Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation
AUTHORS: Hanxin Wang ; Tian Liu ; Shu Kong
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: By comparing different adaptation methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation, and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.

HIGHLIGHT: However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g., widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities (over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two key innovations.

AUTHORS: Kai Wang ; Yihao Zhang ; Meng Sun
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CR, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs, which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models' explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven, intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy.

149, TITLE: LeanPO: Lean Preference Optimization for Likelihood Alignment in Video-LLMs
AUTHORS: Xiaodong Wang ; Jinfa Huang ; Li Yuan ; Peixi Peng

HIGHLIGHT: However, the likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta (y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training, inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs, showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video content.

HIGHLIGHT: This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for a polygonal approximation of a closed digital curve.

308, TITLE: Teaming in The AI Era: AI-Augmented Frameworks for Forming, Simulating, and Optimizing Human Teams
AUTHORS: Mohammed Almutairi
CATEGORY: cs.HC [cs.HC, cs.AI, cs.MA]
HIGHLIGHT: My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance team satisfaction, engagement, and performance.

309, TITLE: Clustering and Median Aggregation Improve Differentially Private Inference
AUTHORS: KAREEM AMIN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing medians instead of averages.

310, TITLE: Perturbative Gradient Training: A Novel Training Paradigm for Bridging The Gap Between Deep Neural Networks and Physical Reservoir Computing
AUTHORS: Cliff B. Abbott ; Mark Elo ; Dmytro A. Bozhko
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cond-mat.mes-hall, cs.ET, cs.NE, physics.comp-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical reservoirs.

311, TITLE: Explicit Density Approximation for Neural Implicit Samplers Using A Bernstein-Based Convex Divergence
AUTHORS: Jos� Manuel de Frutos ; Manuel A. V�zquez ; Pablo M. Olmos ; Joaqu�n M�guez
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, math.PR, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model densities.

312, TITLE: MesaNet: Sequence Modeling By Locally Optimal Test-Time Training
AUTHORS: JOHANNES VON OSWALD et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective, approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale.

313, TITLE: Behavioural Vs. Representational Systematicity in End-to-End Models: An Opinionated Survey
AUTHORS: Ivan Vegner ; Sydelle de Souza ; Valentin Forch ; Martha Lewis ; Leonidas A. A. Doumas
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, I.2.6; I.2.0; I.2.7]
HIGHLIGHT: However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction.

314, TITLE: Grokking and Generalization Collapse: Insights from \texttt{HTSR} Theory
AUTHORS: Hari K. Prakash ; Charles H. Martin
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a 3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar \emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy stays perfect.

315, TITLE: Inference-Time Hyper-Scaling with KV Cache Compression
AUTHORS: Adrian ?a?cucki ; Konrad Staniszewski ; Piotr Nawrot ; Edoardo M. Ponti
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: To make hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention.

316, TITLE: Towards Network Data Analytics in 5G Systems and Beyond
AUTHORS: Marcos Lima Romero ; Ricardo Suyama
CATEGORY: cs.NI [cs.NI, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70 articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and explore its potential for monetization.

318, TITLE: Synthetic Dataset Generation for Autonomous Mobile Robots Using 3D Gaussian Splatting for Vision Training
AUTHORS: ANEESH DEOGAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This challenge is particularly pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in Unreal Engine.

319, TITLE: MineInsight: A Multi-sensor Dataset for Humanitarian Demining Robotics in Off-Road Environments

HIGHLIGHT: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are coherent with graphemes.

321, TITLE: Beyond Worst-Case Analysis for Symbolic Computation: Root Isolation Algorithms
AUTHORS: Alperen A. Erg�r ; Josu� Tonelli-Cueto ; Elias Tsigaridas
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC, cs.CC, math.AG, math.PR, 65H04, 14Q20, 68W30]
HIGHLIGHT: However, most available results in literature either focus on worst-case analysis in the bit complexity model or simply provide experimental benchmarking without any theoretical justifications of the observed results. We aim to address the discrepancy between practical performance of root isolation algorithms and prescriptions of worst-case complexity theory: We develop a smoothed analysis framework for polynomials with integer coefficients to bridge this gap.
