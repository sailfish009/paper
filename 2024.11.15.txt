81, TITLE: DeBaTeR: Denoising Bipartite Temporal Graph for Recommendation
AUTHORS: XINYU HE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.IR [cs.IR, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Time information, while enhancing the model utility, also bears its natural advantage in helping to determine noisy edges, e.g., if someone usually watches horror movies at night and talk shows in the morning, a record of watching a horror movie in the morning is more likely to be noisy interaction. Armed with this observation, we introduce a simple yet effective mechanism for generating time-aware user/item embeddings and propose two strategies for denoising bipartite temporal graph in recommender systems (DeBaTeR): the first is through reweighting the adjacency matrix (DeBaTeR-A), where a reliability score is defined to reweight the edges through both soft assignment and hard assignment; the second is through reweighting the loss function (DeBaTeR-L), where weights are generated to reweight user-item samples in the losses.

AUTHORS: ABDURAHMAN ALI MOHAMMED et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a new annotated microscopic cellular image dataset to improve the effectiveness of machine learning methods for cellular image analysis.

155, TITLE: RibCageImp: A Deep Learning Framework for 3D Ribcage Implant Generation
AUTHORS: Gyanendra Chaubey ; Aiman Farooq ; Azad Singh ; Deepak Mishra
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we explore the feasibility of automated ribcage implant generation using deep learning.

156, TITLE: Automated Segmentation of Ischemic Stroke Lesions in Non-Contrast Computed Tomography Images for Enhanced Treatment and Prognosis
AUTHORS: Toufiq Musah ; Prince Ebenezer Adjei ; Kojo Obed Otoo
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the standard and most widely available imaging method for confirming strokes and their sub-types, the NCCT, is more challenging and time-consuming to employ in cases of ischemic stroke. For this reason, we developed an automated method for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation in NCCTs using the nnU-Net frame work, aimed at enhancing early treatment and improving the prognosis of ischemic stroke patients.

157, TITLE: An Explainable Attention Model for Cervical Precancer Risk Classification Using Colposcopic Images
AUTHORS: Smith K. Khare ; Berit Bargum Booth ; Victoria Blanes-Vidal ; Lone Kjeld Petersen ; Esmaeil S. Nadimi
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents the Cervix-AID-Net model for cervical precancer risk classification.
