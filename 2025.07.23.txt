159, TITLE: Quality Text, Robust Vision: The Role of Language in Enhancing Visual Robustness of Vision-Language Models
AUTHORS: Futa Waseda ; Saku Sugawara ; Isao Echizen
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing adversarialtraining (AT) methods for robust fine-tuning largely overlook the role oflanguage in enhancing visual robustness. Specifically, (1) supervised ATmethods rely on short texts (e.g., class labels) to generate adversarialperturbations, leading to overfitting to object classes in the training data,and (2) unsupervised AT avoids this overfitting but remains suboptimal againstpractical text-guided adversarial attacks due to its lack of semantic guidance.To address these limitations, we propose Quality Text-guided AdversarialFine-Tuning (QT-AFT), which leverages high-quality captions during training toguide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images.

HIGHLIGHT: We introduce NDSI-BWE, a new adversarial Band WidthExtension (BWE) framework that leverage four new discriminators inspired bynonlinear dynamical system to capture diverse temporal behaviors: aMulti-Resolution Lyapunov Discriminator (MRLD) for determining sensitivity toinitial conditions by capturing deterministic chaos, a Multi-Scale RecurrenceDiscriminator (MS-RD) for self-similar recurrence dynamics, a Multi-ScaleDetrended Fractal Analysis Discriminator (MSDFA) for long range slow variantscale invariant relationship, a Multi-Resolution Poincar\'e Plot Discriminator(MR-PPD) for capturing hidden latent space relationship, a Multi-PeriodDiscriminator (MPD) for cyclical patterns, a Multi-Resolution AmplitudeDiscriminator (MRAD) and Multi-Resolution Phase Discriminator (MRPD) forcapturing intricate amplitude-phase transition statistics.

HIGHLIGHT: In doing so, wetake inspiration from both optimal control and neuroscience theory, and definea spiking rule where spikes are only emitted if they bring a dynamical systemcloser to a target. From this principle, we derive the required connectivityfor an SNN, and show that it can successfully control linear systems.
