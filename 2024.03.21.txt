184, TITLE: Bridge The Modality and Capacity Gaps in Vision-Language Model Selection
AUTHORS: Chao Yi ; De-Chuan Zhan ; Han-Jia Ye
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Thus, a promising zero-shot image classification strategy is selecting the most appropriate Pre-Trained VLM from the VLM Zoo, relying solely on the text data of the target dataset without access to the dataset's images. In this paper, we analyze two inherent challenges in assessing the ability of a VLM in this Language-Only VLM selection: the "Modality Gap" -- the disparity in VLM's embeddings across two different modalities, making text a less reliable substitute for images; and the "Capability Gap" -- the discrepancy between the VLM's overall ranking and its ranking for target dataset, hindering direct prediction of a model's dataset-specific performance from its general performance.
