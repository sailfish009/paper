To overcome this difficulty, we propose two alternative minimization approaches whose applicability depends on the smoothness of the used perception metric: a Newton-based Alternating Minimization (NAM) scheme, relying on Newton's root-finding method for the approximation of the optimal iteration solution, and a Relaxed Alternating Minimization (RAM) scheme, based on a relaxation of the OAM iterates.

CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]

160, TITLE: DIAGen: Diverse Image Augmentation with Generative Models

To overcome this challenge, we propose DIAGen, building upon DA-Fusion.

In this paper we introduce the 1-extendable chromatic number, which is the minimum size of a partition of the vertex set of a graph such that each part induces a 1-extendable graph.
