HIGHLIGHT: Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transferlearning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPLcitations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, wedevelop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, andapplications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-basedretrieval approach.

To address this, we propose atraining-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates theimpact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts fromthe image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrievalof highly relevant knowledge.

HIGHLIGHT: Inpractice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mentalmath tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction withoutexplicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibitinginput-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routesof information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, andforcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.With two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) andAttention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) withhigh accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningfulcomputation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the lasttoken, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middlelayers.
