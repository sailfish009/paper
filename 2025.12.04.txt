2, TITLE: Principled RL for Diffusion LLMs Emerges from A Sequence-Level Perspective
AUTHORS: Jingyang Ou; Jiaqi Han; Minkai Xu; Shaoxuan Xu; Jianwen Xie; Stefano Ermon; Yi Wu; Chongxuan Li
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: The core difficulty lies in likelihood approximation: while autoregressive models naturally provide token-level conditional probabilities essential for token-level RL objectives (e.g., GRPO), dLLMs generate sequences through iterative non-autoregressive denoising steps that lack this factorization. To address this fundamental mismatch, we propose ELBO-based Sequence-level Policy Optimization (ESPO), a principled RL framework that treats entire sequence generation as a single action and uses the ELBO as a tractable sequence-level likelihood proxy.

AUTHORS: Letian Zhou; Songhua Liu; Xinchao Wang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Second, although some methods turn to general text-to-image models without relying on such target-specific training, they suffer from a significant distributional mismatch, as the web-scale priors encapsulated in these foundation models fail to faithfully capture the target-specific semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose Core Distribution Alignment (CoDA), a framework that enables effective DD using only an off-the-shelf text-to-image model.

AUTHORS: Zhishan Zhou; Siyuan Wei; Zengran Wang; Chunjie Wang; Xiaosheng Yan; Xiao Liu

AUTHORS: Jiaze Li; Yan Lu; Bin Liu; Guojun Yin; Mang Ye
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]

HIGHLIGHT: Recent studies in large language models (LLMs) show that rotation-based techniques can smooth outliers and enable 4-bit quantization, but these approaches often incur substantial overhead and struggle with row-wise outliers in diffusion transformers. To address these challenges, we propose ConvRot, a group-wise rotation-based quantization method that leverages regular Hadamard transform (RHT) to suppress both row-wise and column-wise outliers while reducing complexity from quadratic to linear.

AUTHORS: Ivan Yee Lee; Cheng Yang; Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick

HIGHLIGHT: We test two assumptions implicit in the optical-compression narrative: that vision-based compression provides unique advantages for text reconstruction from compressed representations, and that DeepSeek-OCR's reconstruction results are evidence that vision-based compression will be useful for language modeling. Comparing their vision encoder against simple alternatives--parameter-free mean pooling and a learned hierarchical encoder--we find that these simple approaches match or surpass vision for reconstruction at matched compression ratios, and outperform it for language modeling--where vision-based compression fails to beat truncation.
