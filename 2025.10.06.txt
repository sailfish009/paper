286, TITLE: Deep Generative Continual Learning Using Functional LoRA: FunLoRA
AUTHORS: Victor Enescu; Hichem Sahbi
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) thecontinually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performancedegradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and moreexpressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rankadaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whosereparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selectedfunctions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamicconditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophicforgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methodsurpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reachinghigher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of thememory cost and sampling time.
