AUTHORS: Beibei Jing ; Youjia Zhang ; Zikai Song ; Junqing Yu ; Wei Yang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Generating realistic human motion sequences from text descriptions is a challenging task that requires capturing the rich expressiveness of both natural language and human motion.Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled significant progress in human motion synthesis.However, existing methods struggle to handle text inputs that describe complex or long motions.In this paper, we propose the Adaptable Motion Diffusion (AMD) model, which leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse the input text into a sequence of concise and interpretable anatomical scripts that correspond to the target motion.This process exploits the LLM's ability to provide anatomical guidance for complex motion synthesis.We then devise a two-branch fusion scheme that balances the influence of the input text and the anatomical scripts on the inverse diffusion process, which adaptively ensures the semantic fidelity and diversity of the synthesized motion.Our method can effectively handle texts with complex or long motion descriptions, where existing methods often fail.

To address these issues, we propose 1) a more challenging reformulation of temporal self-supervision as frame-level (rather than clip-level) recognition tasks and 2) an effective augmentation strategy to mitigate shortcuts.
