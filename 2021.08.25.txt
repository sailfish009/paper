83, TITLE:	DU-GAN: Generative Adversarial Networks with Dual-Domain U-Net Based Discriminators for Low-Dose CT Denoising
AUTHORS:	Zhizhong Huang ; Junping Zhang ; Yi Zhang ; Hongming Shan
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT:
	To better regularize the LDCT denoising model, this paper proposes a 
novel method, termed DU-GAN, which leverages U-Net based discriminators 
in the GANs framework to learn both global and local difference between 
the denoised and normal-dose images in both image and gradient domains.

AUTHORS:	HONGLEI ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:

AUTHORS:	Muhammad Dawood ; Kim Branson ; Nasir M. Rajpoot ; Fayyaz ul Amir Afsar Minhas
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT:
	In this work, we propose a "stain-aware" machine learning approach for 
prediction of spatial transcriptomic gene expression profiles using 
digital pathology image of a routine Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) 
histology section.

	In this work, we propose a two-stage autoencoder based 
compressor-decompressor framework for compressing malaria RBC cell image
 patches.
