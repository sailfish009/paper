Motivated by this observation, we propose an inference-stagetechnique to short-circuit those feature coordinates that spurious gradientsexploit to inflate OOD confidence, while leaving ID classification largelyintact.

HIGHLIGHT: With the development of LLM-basedagents and reinforcement-learning-based reasoning models, the study of applyingreinforcement learning in agent frameworks has become a new research focus.However, all previous studies face the challenge of deciding the tool callingprocess and the reasoning process simultaneously, and the chain of reasoningwas solely relied on the unprocessed raw result with redundant information andsymbols unrelated to the task from the tool, which impose a heavy burden on themodel's capability to reason. Therefore, in our research, we proposed ahierarchical framework Agent-as-tool that detach the tool calling process andthe reasoning process, which enables the model to focus on the verballyreasoning process while the tool calling process is handled by another agent.Our work had achieved comparable results with only a slight reinforcementfine-tuning on 180 samples, and had achieved exceptionally well performance inBamboogle with 63.2% of exact match and 75.2% in cover exact match, exceedingSearch-R1 by 4.8% in exact match and 3.2% in cover exact match.
