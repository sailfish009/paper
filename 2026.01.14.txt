1, TITLE: Conditional Memory Via Scalable Lookup: A New Axis of Sparsity for Large Language Models
AUTHORS: XIN CHENG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scales capacity via conditional computation, Transformers lack a native primitive for knowledge lookup, forcing them to inefficiently simulate retrieval through computation. To address this, we introduce conditional memory as a complementary sparsity axis, instantiated via Engram, a module that modernizes classic $N$-gram embedding for O(1) lookup.  [Save to Library]

2, TITLE: BabyVision: Visual Reasoning Beyond Language
AUTHORS: LIANG CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.CL]

To systematically investigate this gap, we introduce BabyVision, a benchmark designed to assess core visual abilities independent of linguistic knowledge for MLLMs.  [Save to Library]

3, TITLE: Watching, Reasoning, and Searching: A Video Deep Research Benchmark on Open Web for Agentic Video Reasoning
AUTHORS: CHENGWEN LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: VideoDR centers on video-conditioned open-domain video question answering, requiring cross-frame visual anchor extraction, interactive web retrieval, and multi-hop reasoning over joint video-web evidence; through rigorous human annotation and quality control, we obtain high-quality video deep research samples spanning six semantic domains. We evaluate multiple closed-source and open-source multimodal large language models under both the Workflow and Agentic paradigms, and the results show that Agentic is not consistently superior to Workflow: its gains depend on a model's ability to maintain the initial video anchors over long retrieval chains.

HIGHLIGHT: Maximal Update Parametrization ($\boldsymbol?$P) provides a theoretical safeguard for width-invariant $?(1)$ activation control, whereas emerging optimizers like Muon are only ``half-aligned'' with these constraints: they control updates but allow weights to drift. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Spectral Sphere Optimizer (SSO)}, which enforces strict module-wise spectral constraints on both weights and their updates.  [Save to Library]

AUTHORS: QITAN LV et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously recognize novel classes under limited data, which suffers from the key stability-plasticity dilemma: balancing the retention of old knowledge with the acquisition of new knowledge. To address this issue, we divide the task into two different stages and propose a framework termed Static-Dynamic Collaboration (SDC) to achieve a better trade-off between stability and plasticity.

70, TITLE: Inferring Latent Intentions: Attributional Natural Language Inference in LLM Agents
AUTHORS: Xin Quan ; Jiafeng Xiong ; Marco Valentino ; Andr� Freitas
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Traditional natural language inference (NLI), in fact, fails to capture the nuanced, intention-driven reasoning essential for complex interactive systems. To address this gap, we introduce Attributional NLI (Att-NLI), a framework that extends NLI with principles from social psychology to assess an agent's capacity for abductive intentional inference (generating hypotheses about latent intentions), and subsequent deductive verification (drawing valid logical conclusions).

71, TITLE: M3SR: Multi-Scale Multi-Perceptual Mamba for Efficient Spectral Reconstruction
AUTHORS: YUZE ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although the Mamba architecture has been adopted for spectral reconstruction, it still faces the following two challenges: (1) Single spatial perception limits the ability to fully understand and analyze hyperspectral images; (2) Single-scale feature extraction struggles to capture the complex structures and fine details present in hyperspectral images. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale, multi-perceptual Mamba architecture for the spectral reconstruction task, called M3SR.  [Save to Library]

AUTHORS: Chaoyu Li ; Deeparghya Dutta Barua ; Fei Tao ; Pooyan Fazli
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Repeated sampling over the same input often produces divergent reasoning trajectories and inconsistent final predictions. To address this, we introduce two complementary approaches inspired by test-time scaling: (1) CASHEW, an inference-time framework that stabilizes reasoning by iteratively aggregating multiple candidate trajectories into higher-quality reasoning traces, with explicit visual verification filtering hallucinated steps and grounding reasoning in visual evidence, and (2) CASHEW-RL, a learned variant that internalizes this aggregation behavior within a single model.
