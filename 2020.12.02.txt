110, TITLE:     Deep Ad-hoc Beamforming Based On Speaker Extraction For Target-Dependent Speech Separation
http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00403
AUTHORS:        Ziye Yang ; Shanzheng Guan ; Xiao-Lei Zhang
CATEGORY:       cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we propose deep ad-hoc beamforming based on speaker extraction, which is to our knowledge the first work for target-dependent speech separation based on ad-hoc microphone arrays and deep learning.

111, TITLE:     Mutual Information Constraints For Monte-Carlo Objectives
http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00708
AUTHORS:        Gábor Melis ; András György ; Phil Blunsom
COMMENTS:       32 pages, 29 figures
CATEGORY:       stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:      Estimating the mutual information as the average Kullback-Leibler divergence between the easily available variational posterior $q(z|x)$ and the prior does not work with Monte-Carlo objectives because $q(z|x)$ is no longer a direct approximation to the model's true posterior $p(z|x)$.

112, TITLE:     A Unified Deep Speaker Embedding Framework For Mixed-Bandwidth Speech Data
http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00486
AUTHORS:        Weicheng Cai ; Ming Li
CATEGORY:       eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT:      This paper proposes a unified deep speaker embedding framework for modeling speech data with different sampling rates.

113, TITLE:     Overcoming The Limitations Of Patch-based Learning To Detect Cancer In Whole Slide Images
http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00617
AUTHORS:        Ozan Ciga ; Tony Xu ; Sharon Nofech-Mozes ; Shawna Noy ; Fang-I Lu ; Anne L. Martel
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT:      In this paper, we outline the differences between patch or slide-level classification versus methods that need to localize or segment cancer accurately across the whole slide, and we experimentally verify that best practices differ in both cases.

114, TITLE:     Model Adaptation For Inverse Problems In Imaging
http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00139
AUTHORS:        Davis Gilton ; Gregory Ongie ; Rebecca Willett
CATEGORY:       eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:      Given a network trained to solve an initial inverse problem with a known forward model, we propose two novel procedures that adapt the network to a perturbed forward model, even without full knowledge of the perturbation.
