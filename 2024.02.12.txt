81, TITLE: Asking The Right Question at The Right Time: Human and Model Uncertainty Guidance to Ask Clarification Questions
AUTHORS: Alberto Testoni ; Raquel Fern�ndez

To address this issue, we propose an approach to generating clarification questions based on model uncertainty estimation, compare it to several alternatives, and show that it leads to significant improvements in terms of task success.

82, TITLE: Learn To Be Efficient: Build Structured Sparsity in Large Language Models

AUTHORS: Jongmin Yoon ; Juho Lee
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: One key reason for the slow sampling speed of the ODE-based solvers that simulate these generative models is the global truncation error of the ODE solver, caused by the high curvature of the ODE trajectory, which explodes the truncation error of the numerical solvers in the low-NFE regime. To address this challenge, We propose a novel method called SeqRF, a learning technique that straightens the probability flow to reduce the global truncation error and hence enable acceleration of sampling and improve the synthesis quality.
