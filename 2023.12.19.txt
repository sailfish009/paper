CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Although a systematic framework exists for this approach, its performance is hindered by: (1) a dependency on a number of design parameters that directly affect the selection of a safety threshold and therefore likely affect its robustness, (2) an inherent assumption of certain distributions for the training and operational sets, as well as (3) a high computational complexity for relatively large sets. This work addresses these limitations by changing the binary decision to a continuous metric.

To address these issues in an end-to-end manner, we model the brain network as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to discover direct causal connections between brain regions and propose Spatial-Temporal DAG Convolutional Network (ST-DAGCN) to jointly infer effective connectivity and classify rs-fMRI time series by learning brain representations based on nonlinear structural equation model.

AUTHORS: Sandesh Kamath ; Sankalp Mittal ; Amit Deshpande ; Vineeth N Balasubramanian
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CR, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We observe two main causes for fragile attributions: first, the existing metrics of robustness (e.g., top-k intersection) over-penalize even reasonable local shifts in attribution, thereby making random perturbations to appear as a strong attack, and second, the attribution can be concentrated in a small region even when there are multiple important parts in an image. To rectify this, we propose simple ways to strengthen existing metrics and attribution methods that incorporate locality of pixels in robustness metrics and diversity of pixel locations in attributions.
