AUTHORS: XIN JIN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, implementing RAW image-based view synthesis directly using 3DGS is challenging due to its inherent drawbacks: 1) in nighttime scenes, extremely low SNR leads to poor structure-from-motion (SfM) estimation in distant views; 2) the limited representation capacity of spherical harmonics (SH) function is unsuitable for RAW linear color space; and 3) inaccurate scene structure hampers downstream tasks such as refocusing.

HIGHLIGHT: Personalizing a large-scale pretrained Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model is challenging as it typically struggles to make an appropriate trade-off between its training data distribution and the target distribution, i.e., learning a novel concept with only a few target images to achieve personalization (aligning with the personalized target) while preserving text editability (aligning with diverse text prompts). In this paper, we propose PaRa, an effective and efficient Parameter Rank Reduction approach for T2I model personalization by explicitly controlling the rank of the diffusion model parameters to restrict its initial diverse generation space into a small and well-balanced target space.

HIGHLIGHT: More accurate models such as TransUNet, Swin-UNet, and CS-UNet have higher computation complexity. To address this problem, we propose GCtx-UNet, a lightweight segmentation architecture that can capture global and local image features with accuracy better or comparable to the state-of-the-art approaches.

388, TITLE: The ULS23 Challenge: A Baseline Model and Benchmark Dataset for 3D Universal Lesion Segmentation in Computed Tomography
AUTHORS: M. J. J. DE GRAUW et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While numerous benchmarks and challenges address lesion segmentation in specific organs like the liver, kidneys, and lungs, the larger variety of lesion types encountered in clinical practice demands a more universal approach. To address this gap, we introduced the ULS23 benchmark for 3D universal lesion segmentation in chest-abdomen-pelvis CT examinations.
