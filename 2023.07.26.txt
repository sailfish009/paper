6, TITLE: Argument Attribution Explanations in Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks
AUTHORS: Xiang Yin ; Nico Potyka ; Francesca Toni
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While there is a considerable body of research on qualitatively explaining the reasoning outcomes of AFs with debates/disputes/dialogues in the spirit of \emph{extension-based semantics}, explaining the quantitative reasoning outcomes of AFs under \emph{gradual semantics} has not received much attention, despite widespread use in applications. In this paper, we contribute to filling this gap by proposing a novel theory of \emph{Argument Attribution Explanations (AAEs)} by incorporating the spirit of feature attribution from machine learning in the context of Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs): whereas feature attribution is used to determine the influence of features towards outputs of machine learning models, AAEs are used to determine the influence of arguments towards \emph{topic argument}s of interest.

82, TITLE: Federated Split Learning with Only Positive Labels for Resource-constrained IoT Environment
AUTHORS: Praveen Joshi ; Chandra Thapa ; Mohammed Hasanuzzaman ; Ted Scully ; Haithem Afli
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Nevertheless, when resource-constrained IoT devices have only positive labeled data, multiclass classification deep learning models in SFL fail to converge or provide suboptimal results. To overcome these challenges, we propose splitfed learning with positive labels (SFPL).

83, TITLE: Fairness Under Demographic Scarce Regime
AUTHORS: Patrik Joslin Kenfack ; Samira Ebrahimi Kahou ; Ulrich Aïvodji

88, TITLE: FedMEKT: Distillation-based Embedding Knowledge Transfer for Multimodal Federated Learning
AUTHORS: HUY Q. LE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Furthermore, the majority of FL approaches still rely on the labeled data at the client side, which is limited in real-world applications due to the inability of self-annotation from users. In light of these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal FL framework that employs a semi-supervised learning approach to leverage the representations from different modalities.

94, TITLE: RoSAS: Deep Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection with Contamination-Resilient Continuous Supervision
AUTHORS: HONGZUO XU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, they still suffer from two limitations: 1) unlabeled anomalies (i.e., anomaly contamination) may mislead the learning process when all the unlabeled data are employed as inliers for model training; 2) only discrete supervision information (such as binary or ordinal data labels) is exploited, which leads to suboptimal learning of anomaly scores that essentially take on a continuous distribution. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised anomaly detection method, which devises \textit{contamination-resilient continuous supervisory signals}.

AUTHORS: Henry DeYoung ; Andreia Mordido ; Frank Pfenning ; Ankush Das

We present and prove correct an effective saturation-based decision procedure for parametric subtyping, demonstrating its applicability using a variety of examples.

AUTHORS: Abhiroop Sarkar ; Robert Krook ; Alejandro Russo ; Koen Claessen

AUTHORS: Xutian Deng ; Junnan Jiang ; Wen Cheng ; Miao Li
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite the recent progress, it is still a challenge to enable robots to autonomously accomplish the ultrasound examination, which is largely due to the lack of a proper task representation method, and also an adaptation approach to generalize learned skills across different patients. To solve these problems, we propose the latent task representation and the robotic skills adaptation for autonomous ultrasound in this paper.
