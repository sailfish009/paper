AUTHORS: Jinjun Peng; Magnus Saebo; Tianjun Zhong; Yi-Jie Cheng; Junfeng Yang; Baishakhi Ray; Simin Chen; Yangruibo Ding
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the "physics" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search.

10, TITLE: Less Noise, More Voice: Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning Via Instruction Purification
AUTHORS: Yiju Guo; Tianyi Hu; Zexu Sun; Yankai Lin
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]

AUTHORS: Zijin Yang; Yu Sun; Kejiang Chen; Jiawei Zhao; Jun Jiang; Weiming Zhang; Nenghai Yu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Accurate watermark evaluation is critical for algorithm development, yet existing methods have significant limitations: they lack a unified framework for both residual and semantic watermarks, provide results without interpretability, neglect comprehensive security considerations, and often use inappropriate metrics for semantic watermarks. To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs).

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step.

17, TITLE: Adaptive Confidence Gating in Multi-Agent Collaboration for Efficient and Optimized Code Generation
AUTHORS: Haoji Zhang; Yuzhe Li; Zhenqiang Liu; Chenyang Liu; Shenyang Zhang; Yi Zhou

AUTHORS: Wei Wen; Sihang Deng; Tianjun Wei; Keyu Chen; Ruizhi Qiao; Xing Sun
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]

32, TITLE: The Surprising Difficulty of Search in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Wei-Di Chang; Mikael Henaff; Brandon Amos; Gregory Dudek; Scott Fujimoto

AUTHORS: Zhao Wang; Ziliang Zhao; Zhicheng Dou
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop.

35, TITLE: A Tilted Seesaw: Revisiting Autoencoder Trade-off for Controllable Diffusion
AUTHORS: Pu Cao; Yiyang Ma; Feng Zhou; Xuedan Yin; Qing Song; Lu Yang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In recent ImageNet-scale AE studies, we observe a systematic bias toward generative metrics in handling this trade-off: reconstruction metrics are increasingly under-reported, and ablation-based AE selection often favors the best-gFID configuration even when reconstruction fidelity degrades. We theoretically analyze why this gFID-dominant preference can appear unproblematic for ImageNet generation, yet becomes risky when scaling to controllable diffusion: AEs can induce condition drift, which limits achievable condition alignment.

40, TITLE: LMK > CLS: Landmark Pooling for Dense Embeddings
AUTHORS: Meet Doshi; Aashka Trivedi; Vishwajeet Kumar; Parul Awasthy; Yulong Li; Jaydeep Sen; Radu Florian; Sachindra Joshi
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: State-of-the-art sequence encoders typically collapse a variable-length token sequence to a single vector using a pooling operator, most commonly a special [CLS] token or mean pooling over token embeddings. In this paper, we identify systematic weaknesses of these pooling strategies: [CLS] tends to concentrate information toward the initial positions of the sequence and can under-represent distributed evidence, while mean pooling can dilute salient local signals, sometimes leading to worse short-context performance.

AUTHORS: Haozhe Xie; Beichen Wen; Jiarui Zheng; Zhaoxi Chen; Fangzhou Hong; Haiwen Diao; Ziwei Liu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.RO [RO]
HIGHLIGHT: We present DynamicVLA, a framework for dynamic object manipulation that integrates temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation through three key designs: 1) a compact 0.4B VLA using a convolutional vision encoder for spatially efficient, structurally faithful encoding, enabling fast multimodal inference; 2) Continuous Inference, enabling overlapping reasoning and execution for lower latency and timely adaptation to object motion; and 3) Latent-aware Action Streaming, which bridges the perception-execution gap by enforcing temporally aligned action execution.

46, TITLE: SteerEval: A Framework for Evaluating Steerability with Natural Language Profiles for Recommendation
AUTHORS: Joyce Zhou; Weijie Zhou; Doug Turnbull; Thorsten Joachims
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.IR [IR]
HIGHLIGHT: While existing steerability evaluations have shown some success for well-recognized item attributes (e.g., movie genres), we argue that these benchmarks fail to capture the richer forms of user control that motivate steerable recommendations. To address this gap, we introduce SteerEval, an evaluation framework designed to measure more nuanced and diverse forms of steerability by using interventions that range from genres to content-warning for movies.

AUTHORS: Bingqian Li; Xiaolei Wang; Junyi Li; Weitao Li; Long Zhang; Sheng Chen; Wayne Xin Zhao; Ji-Rong Wen
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]

We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers.

58, TITLE: Seg-MoE: Multi-Resolution Segment-wise Mixture-of-Experts for Time Series Forecasting Transformers

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.NE [NE]
HIGHLIGHT: However, amid the ongoing boom in AI research and applications, the translational synergy between these two fields has grown increasingly elusive-hampered by a widening infrastructural incompatibility: modern AI frameworks lack native support for biophysical realism, while neural simulation tools are poorly suited for gradient-based optimization and neuromorphic hardware deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce BrainFuse, a unified infrastructure that provides comprehensive support for biophysical neural simulation and gradient-based learning.

AUTHORS: Haoyu Wang; Guozheng Ma; Shugang Cui; Yilun Kong; Haotian Luo; Li Shen; Mengya Gao; Yichao Wu; Xiaogang Wang; Dacheng Tao
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space.

AUTHORS: Zijie Xu; Zihan Huang; Yiting Dong; Kang Chen; Wenxuan Liu; Zhaofei Yu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.NE [NE]
HIGHLIGHT: We identify error amplification as the key cause: small action approximation errors become temporally correlated across decision steps, inducing cumulative state distribution shift and severe performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Step Residual Potential Initialization (CRPI), a lightweight training-free mechanism that carries over residual membrane potentials across decision steps to suppress temporally correlated errors.

86, TITLE: Towards Geometry-Aware and Motion-Guided Video Human Mesh Recovery
AUTHORS: Hongjun Chen; Huan Zheng; Wencheng Han; Jianbing Shen
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing video-based 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) methods often produce physically implausible results, stemming from their reliance on flawed intermediate 3D pose anchors and their inability to effectively model complex spatiotemporal dynamics. To overcome these deep-rooted architectural problems, we introduce HMRMamba, a new paradigm for HMR that pioneers the use of Structured State Space Models (SSMs) for their efficiency and long-range modeling prowess.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels.

AUTHORS: Mingshuang Luo; Shuang Liang; Zhengkun Rong; Yuxuan Luo; Tianshu Hu; Ruibing Hou; Hong Chang; Yong Li; Yuan Zhang; Mingyuan Gao
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a "see-saw", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\underline{LI}ff\underline{O}rd \underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs.

AUTHORS: Bowen Zhou; Marc-André Fiedler; Ayoub Al-Hamadi
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While recent deep learning approaches for depression detection have shown promise, most rely on limited feature types, overlook explicit cross-modal interactions, and employ simple concatenation or static weighting for fusion. To overcome these limitations, we propose CAF-Mamba, a novel Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework.

103, TITLE: Can David Beat Goliath? On Multi-Hop Reasoning with Resource-Constrained Agents
AUTHORS: Hojae Han; Heeyun Jung; Jongyoon Kim; Seung-won Hwang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Under realistic resource constraints that cannot support large models or dense explorations, however, small language model agents fall into a low-cost, low-accuracy regime, where limited rollout budgets lead to sparse exploration, sparse credit assignment, and unstable training. In this work, we challenge this trade-off and show that small language models can achieve strong multi-hop reasoning under resource constraints.

HIGHLIGHT: We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \textit{how models think} rather than \textit{what they produce}.

107, TITLE: Discovering Hidden Gems in Model Repositories

161, TITLE: WebArbiter: A Principle-Guided Reasoning Process Reward Model for Web Agents
AUTHORS: Yao Zhang; Shijie Tang; Zeyu Li; Zhen Han; Volker Tresp
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context.

206, TITLE: The Depth Delusion: Why Transformers Should Be Wider, Not Deeper
AUTHORS: Md Muhtasim Munif Fahim; Md Rezaul Karim
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Neural scaling laws describe how language model loss decreases with parameters and data, but treat architecture as interchangeable--a billion parameters could arise from a shallow-wide model (10 layers & 8,192 hidden dimension) or a deep-narrow one (80 layers & 2,048 hidden dimension). We propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws decomposing this dependence, finding that optimal depth scales as D* ~ C^0.12 while optimal width scales as W* ~ C^0.34, meaning width should grow 2.8x faster than depth.

To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization.

To address this issue, we present Angle-QPP, a novel and efficient binary-encoder QPP approach with three key innovations: (1) the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) of varying scales to learn rich contextual semantics, (2) a contrastive learning warm-up phase to obtain high-quality initial representation quality, and (3) an angle-based interaction mechanism operating in complex embedding space to effectively capture subtle semantic relationships between queries and documents.

282, TITLE: PGCNet: A Transformer–CNN Hybrid Segmentation Model for Pine Wilt Disease Identification
AUTHORS: Jiying Liu; Yaping Zhang; Xu Chen
CATEGORY: Frontiers in Plant Science [FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing fusion strategies typically adopt simple stacking or parallel designs without an effective hierarchical feature interaction mechanism, resulting in inadequate integration of semantic and detailed information, as well as high computational overhead, which hinders their deployment in edge computing environments. To address these issues, this study proposes PGCNet, a semantic segmentation model that efficiently fuses CNN and Transformer representations.

286, TITLE: Deep Models, Shallow Alignment: Uncovering The Granularity Mismatch in Neural Decoding
AUTHORS: Yang Du; Siyuan Dai; Yonghao Song; Paul M. Thompson; Haoteng Tang; Liang Zhan
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing approaches overlook a fundamental granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, where deep vision models emphasize semantic invariance by suppressing local texture information, whereas neural signals preserve an intricate mixture of low-level visual attributes and high-level semantic content. To address this mismatch, we propose Shallow Alignment, a novel contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate representations of visual encoders rather than their final outputs, thereby striking a better balance between low-level texture details and high-level semantic features.

289, TITLE: Test-Time Compute Games
AUTHORS: Ander Artola Velasco; Dimitrios Rontogiannis; Stratis Tsirtsis; Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CY [CY]
HIGHLIGHT: In our work, we show that the market of LLM-as-a-service is socially inefficient: providers have a financial incentive to increase the amount of test-time compute, even if this increase contributes little to the quality of the outputs. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a reverse second-price auction mechanism where providers bid their offered price and (expected) quality for the opportunity to serve a user, and users pay proportionally to the marginal value generated by the winning provider relative to the second-highest bidder.

297, TITLE: Distribution-Aware Reward Estimation for Test-Time Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Bodong Du; Xuanqi Huang; Xiaomeng Li

To address this, we propose Distribution-AwareReward Estimation (DARE), which shifts reward estimation from a single majority outcome to the full empirical rollout distribution.

309, TITLE: From Consistency to Complementarity: Aligned and Disentangled Multi-modal Learning for Time Series Understanding and Reasoning
AUTHORS: Hang Ni; Weijia Zhang; Fei Wang; Zezhi Shao; Hao Liu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, effective cross-modal integration remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and severe entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, which hinder localized interpretation and complementary reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MADI, a multi-modal LLM enhanced with fine-grained alignment and disentangled interaction, featuring (1) Patch-level Alignment, which enforces physically grounded fine-grained correspondence across heterogeneous modalities, (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction, which separates modality-common semantics into compact discrete latents and adaptively synergizes the purified modality-unique information, and (3) Critical-token Highlighting, which emphasizes informative, query-relevant signals for robust reasoning.

AUTHORS: Kailash A. Hambarde; Hugo Proença
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned. To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry.

324, TITLE: On The Adversarial Robustness of Large Vision-Language Models Under Visual Token Compression
AUTHORS: Xinwei Zhang; Hangcheng Liu; Li Bai; Hao Wang; Qingqing Ye; Tianwei Zhang; Haibo Hu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CR [CR]
HIGHLIGHT: We show that existing encoder-based attacks can substantially overestimate the robustness of compressed LVLMs, due to an optimization-inference mismatch: perturbations are optimized on the full-token representation, while inference is performed through a token-compression bottleneck. To address this gap, we propose the Compression-AliGnEd attack (CAGE), which aligns perturbation optimization with compression inference without assuming access to the deployed compression mechanism or its token budget.

HIGHLIGHT: However, current methods still face three major limitations: insufficient detection accuracy for targets smaller than 20 pixels; artifacts and false textures introduced by Generative Adversarial Network-based enhancement, which lead to increased false detection rates; and the reliance of existing approaches on specialized architectures, resulting in weak generalization capability and difficulty in adapting to multi-scenario deployment requirements. To address these issues, this paper proposes a plug-and-play dual-mechanism collaborative enhancement framework named HD-BSNet.

AUTHORS: Baopu Qiu; Hao Chen; Yuanrong Wu; Changtong Zan; Chao Wei; Weiru Zhang; Xiaoyi Zeng
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.IR [IR]
HIGHLIGHT: However, two key limitations remain: (1) most existing approaches rely on single-perspective CoT reasoning, which fails to capture the multifaceted nature of e-commerce relevance (e.g., user intent vs. attribute-level matching vs. business-specific rules); and (2) although CoT-enhanced LLM's offer rich reasoning capabilities, their high inference latency necessitates knowledge distillation for real-time deployment, yet current distillation methods discard the CoT rationale structure at inference, using it as a transient auxiliary signal and forfeiting its reasoning utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that better exploits CoT semantics throughout the optimization pipeline.

AUTHORS: Minghui Chen; Wenlong Deng; James Zou; Han Yu; Xiaoxiao Li
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In particular, long-horizon agentic workflows exhibit two depth-scaling failure modes: 1) exploding textual gradient, where textual feedback grows exponentially with depth, leading to prohibitively long message and amplifies evaluation biases; and 2) vanishing textual gradient, where limited long-context ability causes models overemphasize partial feedback and compression of lengthy feedback causes downstream messages to lose specificity gradually as they propagate many hops upstream. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), a local learning principle inspired by Equilibrium Propagation in energy-based models.

432, TITLE: Expected Return Causes Outcome-Level Mode Collapse in Reinforcement Learning and How to Fix It with Inverse Probability Scaling
AUTHORS: Abhijeet Sinha; Sundari Elango; Dianbo Liu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings.

499, TITLE: ECSEL: Explainable Classification Via Signomial Equation Learning
AUTHORS: Adia Lumadjeng; Ilker Birbil; Erman Acar
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce ECSEL, an explainable classification method that learns formal expressions in the form of signomial equations, motivated by the observation that many symbolic regression benchmarks admit compact signomial structure.

500, TITLE: Mil-SCORE: Benchmarking Long-Context Geospatial Reasoning and Planning in Large Language Models
AUTHORS: Aadi Palnitkar; Mingyang Mao; Nicholas Waytowich; Vinicius G. Goecks; Tinoosh Mohsenin; Xiaomin Lin
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: This need is especially acute for geospatial planning problems, such as those found in planning for large-scale military operations, which demand fast and accurate reasoning over maps, orders, intelligence reports, and other distributed data. To address this gap, we present MilSCORE (Military Scenario Contextual Reasoning), to our knowledge the first scenario-level dataset of expert-authored, multi-hop questions grounded in a complex, simulated military planning scenario used for training.
