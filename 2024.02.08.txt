HIGHLIGHT: Here we propose to provide solutions to the manufacturing process of LFIA at laboratory-scale, particularly to the controlled and active dispensing of the reagents in the form the Test Lines (TL) and the Control Lines (CL).

162, TITLE: Towards Deterministic End-to-end Latency for Medical AI Systems in NVIDIA Holoscan
AUTHORS: Soham Sinha ; Shekhar Dwivedi ; Mahdi Azizian
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.OS, C.3; J.7; D.2.11; D.2.10; D.4.8]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a system design optimized for heterogeneous GPU workloads, encompassing both compute and graphics tasks.

163, TITLE: Studying Vulnerable Code Entities in R
AUTHORS: Zixiao Zhao ; Millon Madhur Das ; Fatemeh H. Fard
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Pre-trained Code Language Models (Code-PLMs) have shown many advancements and achieved state-of-the-art results for many software engineering tasks in the past few years. These models are mainly targeted for popular programming languages such as Java and Python, leaving out many other ones like R. Though R has a wide community of developers and users, there is little known about the applicability of Code-PLMs for R.

164, TITLE: Bidirectional Autoregressive Diffusion Model for Dance Generation
AUTHORS: CANYU ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CV, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: To authentically capture human behavior, we propose a Bidirectional Autoregressive Diffusion Model (BADM) for music-to-dance generation, where a bidirectional encoder is built to enforce that the generated dance is harmonious in both the forward and backward directions.

165, TITLE: Factorial Basis Method for Q-Series Applications
AUTHORS: Antonio Jimï¿½nez-Pastor ; Ali Kemal Uncu
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC, math.CO, 05A15, 05A30, 68R05, 05-04, G.2.1; I.1.4; F.2.2]
HIGHLIGHT: The Factorial Basis method, initially designed for quasi-triangular, shift-compatible factorial bases, provides solutions to linear recurrence equations in the form of definite-sums. This paper extends the Factorial Basis method to its q-analog, enabling its application in q-calculus.

166, TITLE: Pushing The Limits of Cell Segmentation Models for Imaging Mass Cytometry
AUTHORS: Kimberley M. Bird ; Xujiong Ye ; Alan M. Race ; James M. Brown
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, I.2; I.4; I.4.6]
HIGHLIGHT: In recent years, learning-based segmentation methods have enabled precise quantification of cell type and morphology, but typically rely on large datasets with fully annotated ground truth (GT) labels.

167, TITLE: MIRT: A Simultaneous Reconstruction and Affine Motion Compensation Technique for Four Dimensional Computed Tomography (4DCT)
AUTHORS: ANH-TUAN NGUYEN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, math.OC, 65K10, 68U10, 68W01, 92C55, 94A08]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose the Motion-compensated Iterative Reconstruction Technique (MIRT)- an efficient iterative reconstruction scheme that combines image reconstruction and affine motion estimation in a single update step, based on the analytical gradients of the motion towards both the reconstruction and the affine motion parameters.

168, TITLE: Quantitative Metrics for Benchmarking Medical Image Harmonization
AUTHORS: ABHIJEET PARIDA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, benchmarking the effectiveness of harmonization techniques has been a challenge due to the lack of widely available standardized datasets with ground truths. In this context, we propose three metrics: two intensity harmonization metrics and one anatomy preservation metric for medical images during harmonization, where no ground truths are required.

169, TITLE: Troublemaker Learning for Low-Light Image Enhancement
AUTHORS: YINGHAO SONG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Accordingly, we propose Global Dynamic Convolution (GDC) with O(n) time complexity, which essentially imitates the partial calculation process of self-attention to formulate elementwise correlations.

170, TITLE: Triplet-constraint Transformer with Multi-scale Refinement for Dose Prediction in Radiotherapy
AUTHORS: LU WEN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a triplet-constraint transformer (TCtrans) with multi-scale refinement to predict the high-quality dose distribution.
