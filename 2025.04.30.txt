In this article, we aim to defend the value of post-hoc explanations against this recent critique.

AUTHORS: Jia Wang ; Yunan Mei ; Jiarui Liu ; Xin Fan
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The recent emergence of the segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable adaptation in MIS but cannot be directly applied to one-shot medical image segmentation (MIS) due to its reliance on labor-intensive user interactions and the high computational cost. To cope with these limitations, we propose a novel SAM-guided robust representation learning framework, named RRL-MedSAM, to adapt SAM to one-shot 3D MIS, which exploits the strong generalization capabilities of the SAM encoder to learn better feature representation.

We propose a reformulation of the CVaR optimisation problem by capping the total return of trajectories used in training, rather than simply discarding them, and show that this is equivalent to the original problem if the cap is set appropriately.

AUTHORS: MAINAK SINGHA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, textual prompt tuning often struggles with overfitting to known concepts and may be overly reliant on memorized text features, limiting its adaptability to unseen concepts. To address this limitation, we propose Federated Multimodal Visual Prompt Tuning (FedMVP) that conditions the prompts on comprehensive contextual information -- image-conditioned features and textual attribute features of a class -- that is multimodal in nature.

Therefore, in this work, we propose a defense strategy by including hetero-homo augmented graph construction, $k$NN augmented graph construction, and multi-view node-wise attention modules to mitigate the structural bias of GNNs against adversarial attacks.
