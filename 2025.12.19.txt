CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements.

AUTHORS: Qihao Liu; Chengzhi Mao; Yaojie Liu; Alan Yuille; Wen-Sheng Chu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs.

9, TITLE: Constructive Circuit Amplification: Improving Math Reasoning in LLMs Via Targeted Sub-Network Updates
AUTHORS: Nikhil Prakash; Donghao Ren; Dominik Moritz; Yannick Assogba

AUTHORS: Yiliu Yang; Yilei Jiang; Qunzhong Wang; Yingshui Tan; Xiaoyong Zhu; Sherman S. M. Chow; Bo Zheng; Xiangyu Yue
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, deployer-written policies in natural language are ambiguous and context dependent, so they map poorly to machine-checkable rules, and runtime enforcement is unreliable. Expressing safety policies as sequents, we propose \textsc{QuadSentinel}, a four-agent guard (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles these policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state and enforces them online.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: To address these limitations, we first quantify the self-knowledge awareness of existing search agents via an F1-based decision metric, revealing that methods such as Search-R1 often overlook readily available parametric knowledge. Motivated by these findings, we propose AdaSearch, a simple two-stage, outcome-driven RL framework that disentangles problem solving from the decision of whether to invoke search, and makes this decision process explicit and interpretable.

37, TITLE: Subjective Functions
AUTHORS: Samuel J. Gershman
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: How does this work, and can we endow artificial systems with the same ability? This paper proposes an approach to answering these questions, starting with the concept of a subjective function, a higher-order objective function that is endogenous to the agent (i.e., defined with respect to the agent's features, rather than an external task).

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CR [CR]
HIGHLIGHT: Because the scams are inherently text-based, they raise urgent questions about the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in both current and future automation. We investigate this intersection by interviewing 145 insiders and 5 scam victims, performing a blinded long-term conversation study comparing LLM scam agents to human operators, and executing an evaluation of commercial safety filters.

42, TITLE: StarCraft+: Benchmarking Multi-agent Algorithms in Adversary Paradigm
AUTHORS: Yadong Li; Tong Zhang; Bo Huang; Zhen Cui

AUTHORS: Yuanning Feng; Sinan Wang; Zhengxiang Cheng; Yao Wan; Dongping Chen
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing benchmarks for LLM-as-a-Judge are mainly relying on human-annotated ground truth, which introduces human bias that undermines the assessment of reliability and imposes scalability constraints. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sage, a novel evaluation suite that assesses the quality of LLM judges without necessitating any human annotation.

HIGHLIGHT: Inspired by this capability, given that current MLLMs already encode visual and text information in the same feature space, we hold that visual tokens can be seamlessly inserted into the reasoning process carried by text tokens, where ideally, all visual imagination processes can be encoded by the latent features. To achieve this goal, we propose Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a novel paradigm for unified multi-modal reasoning that expands the auto-regressive capabilities of MLLMs to natively generate continuous visual embeddings, termed latent sketch tokens, as visual thoughts.
