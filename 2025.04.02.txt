134, TITLE: LITA-GS: Illumination-Agnostic Novel View Synthesis Via Reference-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting and Physical Priors
AUTHORS: Han Zhou ; Wei Dong ; Jun Chen
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Directly employing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) on images with adverse illumination conditions exhibits considerable difficulty in achieving high-quality, normally-exposed representations due to: (1) The limited Structure from Motion (SfM) points estimated in adverse illumination scenarios fail to capture sufficient scene details; (2) Without ground-truth references, the intensive information loss, significant noise, and color distortion pose substantial challenges for 3DGS to produce high-quality results; (3) Combining existing exposure correction methods with 3DGS does not achieve satisfactory performance due to their individual enhancement processes, which lead to the illumination inconsistency between enhanced images from different viewpoints. To address these issues, we propose LITA-GS, a novel illumination-agnostic novel view synthesis method via reference-free 3DGS and physical priors.

CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, eess.IV]
HIGHLIGHT: While the importance of data quality in training image classifier Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is widely recognized, the impact of duplicated images in the training set on model generalization and performance has received little attention. In this paper, we address this gap and provide a comprehensive study on the effect of duplicates in image classification.

229, TITLE: Zero-Shot 4D Lidar Panoptic Segmentation
AUTHORS: Yushan Zhang ; Aljo?a O?ep ; Laura Leal-Taix� ; Tim Meinhardt
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the primary challenge in advancing research and developing generalized, versatile methods for spatio-temporal scene understanding in Lidar lies in the scarcity of datasets that provide the necessary diversity and scale of annotations.To overcome these challenges, we propose SAL-4D (Segment Anything in Lidar--4D), a method that utilizes multi-modal robotic sensor setups as a bridge to distill recent developments in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) in conjunction with off-the-shelf Vision-Language foundation models to Lidar. We utilize VOS models to pseudo-label tracklets in short video sequences, annotate these tracklets with sequence-level CLIP tokens, and lift them to the 4D Lidar space using calibrated multi-modal sensory setups to distill them to our SAL-4D model.

235, TITLE: Data Cleansing for GANs
AUTHORS: Naoyuki Terashita ; Hiroki Ohashi ; Satoshi Hara
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: To overcome the first challenge, we propose influence estimation methods that use the Jacobian of the generator's gradient with respect to the discriminator's parameters (and vice versa).

236, TITLE: PRISM-0: A Predicate-Rich Scene Graph Generation Framework for Zero-Shot Open-Vocabulary Tasks
AUTHORS: Abdelrahman Elskhawy ; Mengze Li ; Nassir Navab ; Benjamin Busam
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This is caused by the availability of only small subsets of curated data and exhibits long-tail predicate distribution issues with a lack of predicate diversity adversely affecting downstream tasks. To overcome this, we introduce PRISM-0, a framework for zero-shot open-vocabulary SGG that bootstraps foundation models in a bottom-up approach to capture the whole spectrum of diverse, open-vocabulary predicate prediction.

AUTHORS: SHUYU LI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT: Multi-modal music generation, using multiple modalities like images, video, and text alongside musical scores and audio as guidance, is an emerging research area with broad applications.

240, TITLE: Example-Based Concept Analysis Framework for Deep Weather Forecast Models
AUTHORS: Soyeon Kim ; Junho Choi ; Subeen Lee ; Jaesik Choi
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.HC, 68T07, I.2.1]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite the growing literature that addresses this issue through explainable AI, the applicability of their solutions is often limited due to their AI-centric development. To fill this gap, we follow a user-centric process to develop an example-based concept analysis framework, which identifies cases that follow a similar inference process as the target instance in a target model and presents them in a user-comprehensible format.

241, TITLE: Unleashing The Power of Pre-trained Encoders for Universal Adversarial Attack Detection
AUTHORS: Yinghe Zhang ; Chi Liu ; Shuai Zhou ; Sheng Shen ; Peng Gui
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While existing detection methods, such as Bayesian uncertainty estimation and activation pattern analysis, have achieved progress through feature engineering, their reliance on handcrafted feature design and prior knowledge of attack patterns limits generalization capabilities and incurs high engineering costs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a lightweight adversarial detection framework based on the large-scale pre-trained vision-language model CLIP.
