157, TITLE: Bootstrapping Fuzzers for Compilers of Low-Resource Language Dialects Using Language Models
AUTHORS: Sairam Vaidya; Marcel Böhme; Loris D'Antoni
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.SE [SE]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing approaches typically sacrifice one of these goals by either requiring manually constructed seed corpora for each dialect, or by failing to be effective. We present a dialect-agnostic and dialect-effective grammar-based and coverage-guided fuzzing approach for extensible compilers that combines two key insights from existing work: (i) the grammars of dialects, which already encode the structural and type constraints, can often be extracted automatically from the dialect specification; and (ii) these grammars can be used in combination with pre-trained large language models to automatically generate representative and diverse seed inputs from the full dialect space without requiring any manual input or training data.

158, TITLE: Learning High-Fidelity Cloth Animation Via Skinning-Free Image Transfer
AUTHORS: Rong Wang; Wei Mao; Changsheng Lu; Hongdong Li

HIGHLIGHT: However, due to the lack of explicit skinning supervision, such skinning-based approach often produces misaligned shapes when posing the garment, consequently corrupts the high-frequency signals and fails to recover high-fidelity wrinkles. To tackle this issue, we propose a skinning-free approach by independently estimating posed (i) vertex position for low-frequency posed garment shape, and (ii) vertex normal for high-frequency local wrinkle details.
