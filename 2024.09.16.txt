HIGHLIGHT: Implementing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is a challenging task that requires tailored hardware accelerator architectures and a clear understanding of their performance characteristics when executing the intended AI workload. To facilitate this, we present an automated generation approach for fast performance models to accurately estimate the latency of a DNN mapped onto systematically modeled and concisely described accelerator architectures.

AUTHORS: Benjamin Alt ; Claudius Kienle ; Darko Katic ; Rainer J�kel ; Michael Beetz
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, 68T40, I.2; D.1]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents SPI-DP, a novel first-order optimizer capable of optimizing robot programs with respect to both high-level task objectives and motion-level constraints.

160, TITLE: MAPX: An Explainable Model-agnostic Framework for The Detection of False Information on Social Media Networks
AUTHORS: SARAH CONDRAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we introduce a novel model-agnostic framework, called MAPX, which allows evidence based aggregation of predictions from existing models in an explainable manner.

161, TITLE: Investigating Disentanglement in A Phoneme-level Speech Codec for Prosody Modeling
AUTHORS: SOTIRIOS KARAPIPERIS et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, cs.LG, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: However, recent work on neural codecs which are based on Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) already shows great potential offering distinct advantages. We investigate the prosody modeling capabilities of the discrete space of such an RVQ-VAE model, modifying it to operate on the phoneme-level.

AUTHORS: Ruolan Leslie Famularo ; Dmitry N. Zotkin ; Shihab A. Shamma ; Ramani Duraiswami
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.LG, cs.NE, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: We apply this model to audio processing tasks, including classification and enhancement.

163, TITLE: TapToTab : Video-Based Guitar Tabs Generation Using AI and Audio Analysis
AUTHORS: ALI GHALEB et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CV, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing methods face challenges with consistency and completeness, particularly in detecting fretboards and accurately identifying notes. To address these issues, this paper introduces an advanced approach leveraging deep learning, specifically YOLO models for real-time fretboard detection, and Fourier Transform-based audio analysis for precise note identification.

AUTHORS: EKATERINA REDEKOP et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a novel digital pathology data source called a "volumetric core," obtained via the extraction and co-alignment of serially sectioned tissue sections using a novel morphology-preserving alignment framework.

166, TITLE: DX2CT: Diffusion Model for 3D CT Reconstruction from Bi or Mono-planar 2D X-ray(s)
