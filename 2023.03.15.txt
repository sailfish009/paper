AUTHORS: TENGJUN LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.AI]

167, TITLE: Koos Classification of Vestibular Schwannoma Via Image Translation-Based Unsupervised Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation
AUTHORS: Tao Yang ; Lisheng Wang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: If ceT1 scans and their annotations can be used for unsupervised learning of hrT2 scans, the performance of Koos classifi-cation using unlabeled hrT2 scans will be greatly improved. In this regard, we propose an unsupervised cross-modality domain adaptation method based on im-age translation by transforming annotated ceT1 scans into hrT2 modality and us-ing their annotations to achieve supervised learning of hrT2 modality.

168, TITLE: Homeomorphic Image Registration Via Conformal-Invariant Hyperelastic Regularisation

169, TITLE: FPUS23: An Ultrasound Fetus Phantom Dataset with Deep Neural Network Evaluations for Fetus Orientations, Fetal Planes, and Anatomical Features
AUTHORS: Bharath Srinivas Prabakaran ; Paul Hamelmann ; Erik Ostrowski ; Muhammad Shafique
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To improve the clinical workflow and potentially develop an at-home ultrasound-based fetal monitoring platform, we present a novel fetus phantom ultrasound dataset, FPUS23, which can be used to identify (1) the correct diagnostic planes for estimating fetal biometric values, (2) fetus orientation, (3) their anatomical features, and (4) bounding boxes of the fetus phantom anatomies at 23 weeks gestation.

170, TITLE: TransNetR: Transformer-based Residual Network for Polyp Segmentation with Multi-Center Out-of-Distribution Testing
AUTHORS: Debesh Jha ; Nikhil Kumar Tomar ; Vanshali Sharma ; Ulas Bagci
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: TransNetR obtains a high dice coefficient of 0.8706 and a mean Intersection over union of 0.8016 and retains a real-time processing speed of 54.60 on the Kvasir-SEG dataset. Apart from this, the major contribution of the work lies in exploring the generalizability of the TransNetR by testing the proposed algorithm on the out-of-distribution (test distribution is unknown and different from training distribution) dataset.

AUTHORS: Amel Shamseldeen Ali Alhasan ; Siyuan Zhang ; Benjamin Berkels

HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel method for the automatic motif extraction in real space from crystalline images based on a variational approach involving the unit cell projection operator.

172, TITLE: SuperMask: Generating High-resolution Object Masks from Multi-view, Unaligned Low-resolution MRIs
AUTHORS: HANXUE GU et. al.

AUTHORS: Paul Friedrich ; Julia Wolleb ; Florentin Bieder ; Florian M. Thieringer ; Philippe C. Cattin
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Following the recent success of Diffusion Probabilistic Models, we propose a novel approach for implant generation based on a combination of 3D point cloud diffusion models and voxelization networks.

174, TITLE: Activity Recognition From Newborn Resuscitation Videos
AUTHORS: ØYVIND MEINICH-BACHE et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Methods: We propose a two-step deep neural network system, ORAA-net, utilizing low-quality video recordings of resuscitation episodes to do activity recognition during newborn resuscitation.

AUTHORS: Mst Shapna Akter ; Hossain Shahriar
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.CR, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we have only considered the value of fuel level, and we have come up with a unique solution to filter out the noise of high magnitudes using several algorithms such as interpolation, extrapolation, spectral clustering, agglomerative clustering, wavelet analysis, and median filtering.
