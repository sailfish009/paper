AUTHORS: Li Ma ; Yifan Zhao ; Peixi Peng ; Yonghong Tian
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI, eess.IV]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite their improved performances, prevailing methods only focus on learning a mapping from the compressed image to the original one but ignore the intrinsic attributes of the given compressed images, which greatly harms the performance of downstream parsing tasks. Different from these methods, we propose to decouple the intrinsic attributes into two complementary features for artifacts reduction,ie, the compression-insensitive features to regularize the high-level semantic representations during training and the compression-sensitive features to be aware of the compression degree.

89, TITLE: Classifying Geospatial Objects from Multiview Aerial Imagery Using Semantic Meshes
AUTHORS: David Russell ; Ben Weinstein ; David Wettergreen ; Derek Young

We propose an alternate approach that generates predictions directly on the raw images and accurately maps these predictions into geospatial coordinates using semantic meshes.
