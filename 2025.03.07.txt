AUTHORS: William Merrill ; Ashish Sabharwal
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CC]

We address these questions by analyzing the expressive power of transformers whose depth can grow minimally with context length $n$.

31, TITLE: Benchmarking Reasoning Robustness in Large Language Models
AUTHORS: TONG YU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning such as DeepSeek, we for the first time identify a key dilemma in reasoning robustness and generalization: significant performance degradation on novel or incomplete data, suggesting a reliance on memorized patterns rather than systematic reasoning. Our closer examination reveals four key unique limitations underlying this issue:(1) Positional bias--models favor earlier queries in multi-query inputs but answering the wrong one in the latter (e.g., GPT-4o's accuracy drops from 75.8 percent to 72.8 percent); (2) Instruction sensitivity--performance declines by 5.0 to 7.5 percent in the Qwen2.5 Series and by 5.0 percent in DeepSeek-V3 with auxiliary guidance; (3) Numerical fragility--value substitution sharply reduces accuracy (e.g., GPT-4o drops from 97.5 percent to 82.5 percent, GPT-o1-mini drops from 97.5 percent to 92.5 percent); and (4) Memory dependence--models resort to guesswork when missing critical data.

To address this, we propose TableLoRA, a module designed to improve LLMs' understanding of table structure during PEFT.

35, TITLE: Keeping Yourself Is Important in Downstream Tuning Multimodal Large Language Model
AUTHORS: WENKE HUANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: But tuning MLLMs for downstream tasks encounters two key challenges: Task-Expert Specialization, where distribution shifts between pre-training and target datasets constrain target performance, and Open-World Stabilization, where catastrophic forgetting erases the model general knowledge. In this work, we systematically review recent advancements in MLLM tuning methodologies, classifying them into three paradigms: (I) Selective Tuning, (II) Additive Tuning, and (III) Reparameterization Tuning.

CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing solutions struggle to generalize due to their reliance on hand-curated object lists that overlook unforeseen factors, end-to-end learning of navigation features from scarce large-scale robot datasets, and handcrafted reward functions that scale poorly to diverse scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose CREStE, the first method that learns representations and rewards for addressing the full mapless navigation problem without relying on large-scale robot datasets or manually curated features.

We propose a novel data watermarking approach that injects coherent and plausible yet fictitious knowledge into training data using generated passages describing a fictitious entity and its associated attributes.

230, TITLE: How to Move Your Dragon: Text-to-Motion Synthesis for Large-Vocabulary Objects
AUTHORS: WONKWANG LEE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Motion synthesis for diverse object categories holds great potential for 3D content creation but remains underexplored due to two key challenges: (1) the lack of comprehensive motion datasets that include a wide range of high-quality motions and annotations, and (2) the absence of methods capable of handling heterogeneous skeletal templates from diverse objects. To address these challenges, we contribute the following: First, we augment the Truebones Zoo dataset, a high-quality animal motion dataset covering over 70 species, by annotating it with detailed text descriptions, making it suitable for text-based motion synthesis.
