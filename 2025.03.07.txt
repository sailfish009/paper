We address these questions by analyzing the expressive power of transformers whose depth can grow minimally with context length $n$.

31, TITLE: Benchmarking Reasoning Robustness in Large Language Models
AUTHORS: TONG YU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning such as DeepSeek, we for the first time identify a key dilemma in reasoning robustness and generalization: significant performance degradation on novel or incomplete data, suggesting a reliance on memorized patterns rather than systematic reasoning. Our closer examination reveals four key unique limitations underlying this issue:(1) Positional bias--models favor earlier queries in multi-query inputs but answering the wrong one in the latter (e.g., GPT-4o's accuracy drops from 75.8 percent to 72.8 percent); (2) Instruction sensitivity--performance declines by 5.0 to 7.5 percent in the Qwen2.5 Series and by 5.0 percent in DeepSeek-V3 with auxiliary guidance; (3) Numerical fragility--value substitution sharply reduces accuracy (e.g., GPT-4o drops from 97.5 percent to 82.5 percent, GPT-o1-mini drops from 97.5 percent to 92.5 percent); and (4) Memory dependence--models resort to guesswork when missing critical data.

To address this, we propose TableLoRA, a module designed to improve LLMs' understanding of table structure during PEFT.

35, TITLE: Keeping Yourself Is Important in Downstream Tuning Multimodal Large Language Model
AUTHORS: WENKE HUANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]

In this work, we systematically review recent advancements in MLLM tuning methodologies, classifying them into three paradigms: (I) Selective Tuning, (II) Additive Tuning, and (III) Reparameterization Tuning.

We propose a novel data watermarking approach that injects coherent and plausible yet fictitious knowledge into training data using generated passages describing a fictitious entity and its associated attributes.

230, TITLE: How to Move Your Dragon: Text-to-Motion Synthesis for Large-Vocabulary Objects
AUTHORS: WONKWANG LEE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Motion synthesis for diverse object categories holds great potential for 3D content creation but remains underexplored due to two key challenges: (1) the lack of comprehensive motion datasets that include a wide range of high-quality motions and annotations, and (2) the absence of methods capable of handling heterogeneous skeletal templates from diverse objects. To address these challenges, we contribute the following: First, we augment the Truebones Zoo dataset, a high-quality animal motion dataset covering over 70 species, by annotating it with detailed text descriptions, making it suitable for text-based motion synthesis.
