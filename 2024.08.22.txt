HIGHLIGHT: This article examines the integration of AI into arbitration, arguing that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) allows parties to contractually choose AI-driven arbitration, despite traditional reservations. The article makes three key contributions: (1) It shifts the focus from debates over AI's personhood to the practical aspects of incorporating AI into arbitration, asserting that AI can effectively serve as an arbitrator if both parties agree; (2) It positions arbitration as an ideal starting point for broader AI adoption in the legal field, given its flexibility and the autonomy it grants parties to define their standards of fairness; and (3) It outlines future research directions, emphasizing the importance of empirically comparing AI and human arbitration, which could lead to the development of distinct systems.
