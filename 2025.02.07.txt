We use these insights and introduce a simple strategy, LR-TK0, to enhance the robustness of models without compromising their pre-trained weights.

170, TITLE: Ancient Greek Technology: An Immersive Learning Use Case Described Using A Co-Intelligent Custom ChatGPT Assistant
AUTHORS: Vlasis Kasapakis ; Leonel Morgado
CATEGORY: cs.HC [cs.HC, cs.AI, H.5.1; I.2.1]
HIGHLIGHT: Achieving consistency in immersive learning case descriptions is essential but challenging due to variations in research focus, methodology, and researchers' background. We address these challenges by leveraging the Immersive Learning Case Sheet (ILCS), a methodological instrument to standardize case descriptions, that we applied to an immersive learning case on ancient Greek technology in VRChat.

Therefore, we proposed and evaluated an LLM-powered question-and-answer (QA)-based approach for users to reply to emails by answering a set of simple and short questions generated from the incoming email.

172, TITLE: Multiple Invertible and Partial-Equivariant Function for Latent Vector Transformation to Enhance Disentanglement in VAEs
AUTHORS: Hee-Jun Jung ; Jaehyoung Jeong ; Kangil Kim
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Multiple Invertible and partial-equivariant transformation (MIPE-transformation), to inject inductive bias by 1) guaranteeing the invertibility of latent-to-latent vector transformation while preserving a certain portion of equivariance of input-to-latent vector transformation, called Invertible and partial-equivariant transformation (IPE-transformation), 2) extending the form of prior and posterior in VAE frameworks to an unrestricted form through a learnable conversion to an approximated exponential family, called Exponential Family conversion (EF-conversion), and 3) integrating multiple units of IPE-transformation and EF-conversion, and their training.

We demonstrate this concept by implementing a custom backend for a RISC-V-based accelerator with hardware loops and streaming registers, leveraging knowledge about the hardware at levels of abstraction that match its custom ISA.
