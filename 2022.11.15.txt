9, TITLE: The Generalised Distribution Semantics and Projective Families of Distributions
AUTHORS: Felix Weitkämper
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.DB, cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: This abstracts the core ideas beyond logic programming as such to encompass frameworks from probabilistic databases, probabilistic finite model theory and discrete lifted Bayesian networks. To demonstrate the usefulness of such a general approach, we completely characterise the projective families of distributions representable in the generalised distribution semantics and we demonstrate both that large classes of interesting projective families cannot be represented in a generalised distribution semantics and that already a very limited fragment of logic programming (acyclic determinate logic programs) in the determinsitic part suffices to represent all those projective families that are representable in the generalised distribution semantics at all.

19, TITLE: Controllable Citation Text Generation
AUTHORS: Nianlong Gu ; Richard H. R. Hahnloser
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]

AUTHORS: BINBIN XIE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Nevertheless, we observe serious calibration errors outputted by ONE2SET, especially in the over-estimation of $\varnothing$ token (means "no corresponding keyphrase"). In this paper, we deeply analyze this limitation and identify two main reasons behind: 1) the parallel generation has to introduce excessive $\varnothing$ as padding tokens into training instances; and 2) the training mechanism assigning target to each slot is unstable and further aggravates the $\varnothing$ token over-estimation.

158, TITLE: Long-Range Zero-Shot Generative Deep Network Quantization
AUTHORS: YAN LUO et. al.

To overcome these problems, we propose a novel deep network quantizer, dubbed Long-Range Zero-Shot Generative Deep Network Quantization (LRQ).
