AUTHORS: Siyoon Jin; Seongchan Kim; Dahyun Chung; Jaeho Lee; Hyunwook Choi; Jisu Nam; Jiyoung Kim; Seungryong Kim
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis thatformalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, viavideo-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens captureinstances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-videoattention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. Wefind both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers.Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularizationthat aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance masktracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation.We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-awarevideo generation.

AUTHORS: Jingbiao Mei; Mingsheng Sun; Jinghong Chen; Pengda Qin; Yuhong Li; Da Chen; Bill Byrne
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent Explain-then-Detect approaches, using Chain-of-Thoughtprompting or LMM agents, perform worse than simple SFT baselines, and evenadvanced post-training methods such as GRPO fail to close the gap. Our analysisidentifies two key issues of such systems: important policy-relevant cues suchas targets and attack types are not hypothesized by the model as a likelyexplanation; and the binary reward signal is insufficient to guide reasoning.To address these challenges, we propose ExPO-HM (Explain-then-Detect PolicyOptimization for Hateful Memes), inspired by the training and evaluationprocess of human annotators.

HIGHLIGHT: We introduce dicodensity monads: a generalisation of pointwise codensitymonads generated by functors to monads generated by mixed-variant bifunctors.Our construction is based on the notion of strong dinaturality (also known asBarr dinaturality), and is inspired by denotational models of certain types inpolymorphic lambda calculi - in particular, a form of continuation monads withuniversally quantified variables, such as the Church encoding of the list monadin System F. Extending some previous results on Cayley-style representations,we provide a set of sufficient conditions to establish an isomorphism between amonad and the dicodensity monad for a given bifunctor.
