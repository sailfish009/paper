1, TITLE: Controlled LLM Training on Spectral Sphere
AUTHORS: TIAN XIE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Maximal Update Parametrization ($\boldsymbol?$P) provides a theoretical safeguard for width-invariant $?(1)$ activation control, whereas emerging optimizers like Muon are only ``half-aligned'' with these constraints: they control updates but allow weights to drift. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Spectral Sphere Optimizer (SSO)}, which enforces strict module-wise spectral constraints on both weights and their updates.  [Save to Library]

We introduce two gradient-free, LLM-driven closed-loop methods: Prompt-to-Optimizer (P2O), which uses an LLM to propose the code for small neural-network-based protocols, which are then trained by an inner loop, and Prompt-to-Protocol (P2P), which simply writes an explicit function for the current and its scalar parameters.

88, TITLE: SERM: Self-Evolving Relevance Model with Agent-Driven Learning from Massive Query Streams
AUTHORS: CHENGLONG WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, in large-scale industrial settings with massive query streams, this technique faces two challenges: (1) informative samples are often sparse and difficult to identify, and (2) pseudo-labels generated by the current model could be unreliable. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a Self-Evolving Relevance Model approach (SERM), which comprises two complementary multi-agent modules: a multi-agent sample miner, designed to detect distributional shifts and identify informative training samples, and a multi-agent relevance annotator, which provides reliable labels through a two-level agreement framework.
