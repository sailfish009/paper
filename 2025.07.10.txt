HIGHLIGHT: Although current instructiondatasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them maystill struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains.This is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage oftask types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of theinstruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instructiondata construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system,an informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesisprocess, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation.
