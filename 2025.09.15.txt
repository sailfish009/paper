111, TITLE: SI-FACT: Mitigating Knowledge Conflict Via Self-Improving Faithfulness-Aware Contrastive Tuning
AUTHORS: Shengqiang Fu
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Large Language Models often generate unfaithful responses in knowledgeintensive tasks due to knowledge conflict,that is,a preference for relying oninternal parametric knowledge rather than the provided context.To address thisissue,we propose a novel self improving framework,Self Improving FaithfulnessAware Contrastive Tuning.The framework uses a self instruct mechanism thatallows the base LLM to automatically generate high quality,structuredcontrastive learning data,including anchor samples,semantically equivalentpositive samples,and negative samples simulating unfaithful scenarios.Thisapproach significantly reduces the cost of manualannotation.Subsequently,contrastive learning is applied to train themodel,enabling it to pull faithful responses closer and push unfaithfulresponses farther apart in the representation space.Experiments on knowledgeconflict evaluation benchmarks ECARE KRE and COSE KRE show that the SI FACTmodel based on Llama3 8B Instruct improves the Contextual Recall Rate by 6.2%over the best baseline method,while significantly reducing dependence oninternal memory.The results indicate that SI FACT provides strong effectivenessand high data efficiency in enhancing the contextual faithfulness ofLLMs,offering a practical pathway toward building more proactive andtrustworthy language models.
