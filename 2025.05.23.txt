AUTHORS: Benjamin Schneider ; Dongfu Jiang ; Chao Du ; Tianyu Pang ; Wenhu Chen
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, it remains computationally prohibitive for VideoLLMs, primarily due to two bottlenecks: 1) sequential video decoding, the process of converting the raw bit stream to RGB frames can take up to a minute for hour-long video inputs, and 2) costly prefilling of up to several million tokens for LLM inference, resulting in high latency and memory use. To address these challenges, we propose QuickVideo, a system-algorithm co-design that substantially accelerates long-video understanding to support real-time downstream applications.

HIGHLIGHT: Unlike traditional adversarial perturbations, backdoor attacks represent a stealthier, persistent, and practically significant threat-particularly under the emerging Training-as-a-Service paradigm-but remain largely unexplored in the context of VLA models. To address this gap, we propose BadVLA, a backdoor attack method based on Objective-Decoupled Optimization, which for the first time exposes the backdoor vulnerabilities of VLA models.

AUTHORS: Jiaqi Wang ; Kevin Qinghong Lin ; James Cheng ; Mike Zheng Shou
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Inspired by the human-like thinking process-where people skip reasoning for easy questions but think carefully when needed-we explore how to enable VLMs to first decide when reasoning is necessary. To realize this, we propose TON, a two-stage training strategy: (i) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage with a simple yet effective 'thought dropout' operation, where reasoning traces are randomly replaced with empty thoughts.

To diagnose this phenomenon, we introduce a representation-level evaluation framework using PCA-based similarity and shift, centered kernel alignment, and Fisher information.

HIGHLIGHT: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a wide range of applications, but their ever-increasing size and resource demands make them vulnerable to inference cost attacks, where attackers induce victim LLMs to generate the longest possible output content. In this paper, we revisit existing inference cost attacks and reveal that these methods can hardly produce large-scale malicious effects since they are self-targeting, where attackers are also the users and therefore have to execute attacks solely through the inputs, whose generated content will be charged by LLMs and can only directly influence themselves.

To address this, we introduce SAI-DPO, an algorithm that dynamically selects training data by continuously assessing a model's stage-specific reasoning abilities across different training phases.
