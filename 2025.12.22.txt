AUTHORS: Chenming Zhou; Jiaan Wang; Yu Li; Lei Li; Juan Cao; Sheng Tang

HIGHLIGHT: A critical limitation of current detectors is their failure to generalize to images from unseen generative models, as they often overfit to source-specific semantic cues rather than learning universal generative artifacts. To overcome this, we introduce a simple yet remarkably effective pixel-level mapping pre-processing step to disrupt the pixel value distribution of images and break the fragile, non-essential semantic patterns that detectors commonly exploit as shortcuts.

HIGHLIGHT: These results mirror prior observations with Chlamydia-induced TLR9 signaling, leading us to hypothesize that Chlamydia-induced NOD2 signaling results from lytic events that occur sporadically during the transition between the pathogen’s developmental forms. Given our finding that pre-treating cells with NOD2-stimulatory ligands reduces chlamydial inclusion size and delays the developmental cycle, we hypothesize that the microbe preferentially degrades its PG during development to reduce the generation of NOD2 ligands.
