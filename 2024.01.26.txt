AUTHORS: Xinyue Xu ; Yi Qin ; Lu Mi ; Hao Wang ; Xiaomeng Li
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: However, (1) they often fail to capture the high-order, nonlinear interaction between concepts, e.g., correcting a predicted concept (e.g., "yellow breast") does not help correct highly correlated concepts (e.g., "yellow belly"), leading to suboptimal final accuracy; (2) they cannot naturally quantify the complex conditional dependencies between different concepts and class labels (e.g., for an image with the class label "Kentucky Warbler" and a concept "black bill", what is the probability that the model correctly predicts another concept "black crown"), therefore failing to provide deeper insight into how a black-box model works. In response to these limitations, we propose Energy-based Concept Bottleneck Models (ECBMs).
