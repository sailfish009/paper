HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces a human-centered approach with a ``work companion rover" designed to assist construction workers within their existing practices, aiming to enhance safety and workflow fluency while respecting construction labor's skilled nature.

163, TITLE: Echo-chambers and Idea Labs: Communication Styles on Twitter
AUTHORS: Aleksandra Sorokovikova ; Michael Becker ; Ivan P. Yamshchikov
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.CL, J.4; K.4.1; K.4.2]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper investigates the communication styles and structures of Twitter (X) communities within the vaccination context.

164, TITLE: A State-of-the-practice Release-readiness Checklist for Generative AI-based Software Products
AUTHORS: Harsh Patel ; Dominique Boucher ; Emad Fallahzadeh ; Ahmed E. Hassan ; Bram Adams
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper investigates the complexities of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into software products, with a focus on the challenges encountered for determining their readiness for release.

165, TITLE: Debiasing Cardiac Imaging with Controlled Latent Diffusion Models
AUTHORS: GRZEGORZ SKORUPKO et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: The progress in deep learning solutions for disease diagnosis and prognosis based on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is hindered by highly imbalanced and biased training data. To address this issue, we propose a method to alleviate imbalances inherent in datasets through the generation of synthetic data based on sensitive attributes such as sex, age, body mass index, and health condition.

166, TITLE: Single-Shared Network with Prior-Inspired Loss for Parameter-Efficient Multi-Modal Imaging Skin Lesion Classification
AUTHORS: Peng Tang ; Tobias Lasser
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we introduce a multi-modal approach that efficiently integrates multi-scale clinical and dermoscopy features within a single network, thereby substantially reducing model parameters.

167, TITLE: Brain-Shift: Unsupervised Pseudo-Healthy Brain Synthesis for Novel Biomarker Extraction in Chronic Subdural Hematoma
AUTHORS: Baris Imre ; Elina Thibeau-Sutre ; Jorieke Reimer ; Kuan Kho ; Jelmer M. Wolterink
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a novel method using anatomy-aware unsupervised diffeomorphic pseudo-healthy synthesis to generate brain deformation fields.

168, TITLE: A Robust Ensemble Algorithm for Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation: Generalizability and Clinical Utility Beyond The ISLES Challenge
AUTHORS: EZEQUIEL DE LA ROSA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, image and disease variability hinder the development of generalizable AI algorithms with clinical value. We address this gap by presenting a novel ensemble algorithm derived from the 2022 Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) challenge.
