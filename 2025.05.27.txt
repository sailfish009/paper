To address this problem, we propose MLLM-Guided VLM Fine-Tuning with Joint Inference (MVFT-JI), a novel approach that leverages a pretrained multimodal large language model (MLLM) to construct two complementary training tasks using only unlabeled images: target text retrieval taskand text-to-image retrieval task.

171, TITLE: SP2RINT: Spatially-Decoupled Physics-Inspired Progressive Inverse Optimization for Scalable, PDE-Constrained Meta-Optical Neural Network Training
AUTHORS: PINGCHUAN MA et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: Heuristic methods are fast but oversimplify metasurfaces modulation, often resulting in physically unrealizable designs and significant performance degradation. Simulation-in-the-loop training methods directly optimize a physically implementable metasurface using adjoint methods during end-to-end DONN training, but are inherently computationally prohibitive and unscalable.To address these limitations, we propose SP2RINT, a spatially decoupled, progressive training framework that formulates DONN training as a PDE-constrained learning problem.

176, TITLE: TNG-CLIP:Training-Time Negation Data Generation for Negation Awareness of CLIP
AUTHORS: Yuliang Cai ; Jesse Thomason ; Mohammad Rostami
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, these methods are both time- and compute-intensive, and their evaluations are typically restricted to image-text matching tasks. To expand the horizon, we (1) introduce a training-time negation data generation pipeline such that negation captions are generated during the training stage, which only increases 2.5% extra training time, and (2) we propose the first benchmark, Neg-TtoI, for evaluating text-to-image generation models on prompts containing negation, assessing model's ability to produce semantically accurate images.

Guided by these insights, we propose behavior injection, a task-agnostic data-augmentation scheme applied prior to RL.

AUTHORS: ZONGLIN YANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.CE, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: Specifically, we explore four foundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to formulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most promising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own internal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis space; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment with ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an ensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than defining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4) whether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape than a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search method that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis, progressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations.

To overcome these challenges, we propose Lagrangian-Optimized Robust Embeddings (LORE), a novel unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning framework.

AUTHORS: Georgios Mappouras
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While many speculate how and when A.I. will achieve A.G.I., there is no clear agreement on how A.G.I. can be detected in A.I. models, even when popular tools like the Turing test (and its modern variations) are used to measure their intelligence. In this work, we discuss why traditional methods like the Turing test do not suffice for measuring or detecting A.G.I. and provide a new, practical method that can be used to decide if a (computer or any other) system has reached or surpassed A.G.I. To achieve this, we make two new contributions. First, we present a clear definition for general intelligence (G.I.) and set a G.I. threshold (G.I.T.) that can be used to distinguish between systems that achieve A.G.I. and systems that do not.

733, TITLE: On The Emergence of Linear Analogies in Word Embeddings
AUTHORS: Daniel J. Korchinski ; Dhruva Karkada ; Yasaman Bahri ; Matthieu Wyart
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cond-mat.dis-nn, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Previous observations indicate that this analogy structure: (i) already emerges in the top eigenvectors of the matrix $M(i,j) = P(i,j)/P(i)P(j)$, (ii) strengthens and then saturates as more eigenvectors of $M (i, j)$, which controls the dimension of the embeddings, are included, (iii) is enhanced when using $\log M(i,j)$ rather than $M(i,j)$, and (iv) persists even when all word pairs involved in a specific analogy relation (e.g., king-queen, man-woman) are removed from the corpus. To explain these phenomena, we introduce a theoretical generative model in which words are defined by binary semantic attributes, and co-occurrence probabilities are derived from attribute-based interactions.

816, TITLE: Foundation Models for Tabular Data Within Systemic Contexts Need Grounding
AUTHORS: Tassilo Klein ; Johannes Hoffart
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DB]
HIGHLIGHT: To address this, we introduce the concept of Semantically Linked Tables (SLT), recognizing that tables are inherently connected to both declarative and procedural operational knowledge. We propose Foundation Models for Semantically Linked Tables (FMSLT), which integrate these components to ground tabular data within its true operational context.

HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a framework that integrates two core components to enhance diagnostic transparency.

819, TITLE: Trust, or Don't Predict: Introducing The CWSA Family for Confidence-Aware Model Evaluation
AUTHORS: Kourosh Shahnazari ; Seyed Moein Ayyoubzadeh ; Mohammadali Keshtparvar ; Pegah Ghaffari
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: These metrics either disregard confidence entirely, dilute valuable localized information through averaging, or neglect to suitably penalize overconfident misclassifications, which can be particularly detrimental in real-world systems. We introduce two new metrics Confidence-Weighted Selective Accuracy (CWSA) and its normalized variant CWSA+ that offer a principled and interpretable way to evaluate predictive models under confidence thresholds.

820, TITLE: SETransformer: A Hybrid Attention-Based Architecture for Robust Human Activity Recognition
AUTHORS: Yunbo Liu ; Xukui Qin ; Yifan Gao ; Xiang Li ; Chengwei Feng
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite the success of traditional deep learning models such as CNNs and RNNs, they often struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies and contextual relevance across multiple sensor channels. To address these limitations, we propose SETransformer, a hybrid deep neural architecture that combines Transformer-based temporal modeling with channel-wise squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention and a learnable temporal attention pooling mechanism.
