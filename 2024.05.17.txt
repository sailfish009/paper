HIGHLIGHT: However, this is impractical and requires new secure compilation proofs to support additional speculation mechanisms. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel secure compilation framework that allows lifting the security guarantees provided by Spectre countermeasures from weaker speculative semantics (ignoring some speculation mechanisms) to stronger ones (accounting for the omitted mechanisms) without requiring new secure compilation proofs.

159, TITLE: Influence Maximization in Hypergraphs Using Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms
AUTHORS: Stefano Genetti ; Eros Ribaga ; Elia Cunegatti ; Quintino Francesco Lotito ; Giovanni Iacca
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a multi-objective EA for the IM problem over hypergraphs that leverages smart initialization and hypergraph-aware mutation.

160, TITLE: Detecting Continuous Integration Skip : A Reinforcement Learning-based Approach
AUTHORS: Hajer Mhalla ; Mohamed Aymen Saied
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This study proposes a novel solution that leverages Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to construct an optimal Decision Tree classifier that addresses the imbalanced nature of the data.

161, TITLE: Whole-Song Hierarchical Generation of Symbolic Music Using Cascaded Diffusion Models
AUTHORS: Ziyu Wang ; Lejun Min ; Gus Xia
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.LG, eess.AS, 68Txx]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we make the first attempt to model a full music piece under the realization of compositional hierarchy.

162, TITLE: Building A Luganda Text-to-Speech Model From Crowdsourced Data
AUTHORS: Sulaiman Kagumire ; Andrew Katumba ; Joyce Nakatumba-Nabende ; John Quinn
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we show that the quality of Luganda TTS from Common Voice can improve by training on multiple speakers of close intonation in addition to further preprocessing of the training data.

163, TITLE: Revisiting Deep Audio-Text Retrieval Through The Lens of Transportation
AUTHORS: MANH LUONG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: In adapting LTM to the deep learning context, we introduce the mini-batch Learning-to-match (m-LTM) framework for audio-text retrieval problems.

164, TITLE: Patient-Specific Real-Time Segmentation in Trackerless Brain Ultrasound
AUTHORS: REUBEN DORENT et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we designed the first patient-specific framework that performs brain tumor segmentation in trackerless iUS.

165, TITLE: Analysis of The BraTS 2023 Intracranial Meningioma Segmentation Challenge
AUTHORS: DOMINIC LABELLA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
