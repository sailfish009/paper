AUTHORS: JUNWEI YIN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: While many promising approaches have emerged, most rely on content analysis with limited semantic depth, leading to suboptimal comprehension of news content.To address this limitation, capturing broader-range semantics is essential yet challenging, as it introduces two primary types of noise: fully connecting sentences in news graphs often adds unnecessary structural noise, while highly similar but authenticity-irrelevant sentences introduce feature noise, complicating the detection process. To tackle these issues, we propose BREAK, a broad-range semantics model for fake news detection that leverages a fully connected graph to capture comprehensive semantics while employing dual denoising modules to minimize both structural and feature noise.
