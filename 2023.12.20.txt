HIGHLIGHT: While there exist a number of recommender systems designed for this problem, we point out that they are challenged in accurately capturing the relation (spec., the degree of relevance) between the current and each of the past visits for the patient when obtaining her current health status, which is the basis for recommending medications. To address this limitation, we propose a novel medication recommendation framework, named VITA, based on the following two novel ideas: (1) relevant-Visit selectIon; (2) Target-aware Attention.
