239, TITLE: Analyzing The Runtime of The Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA) on The Concatenated Trap Function
AUTHORS: Yukai Qiao ; Marcus Gallagher
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we provide the first runtime analysis of GOMEA on the concatenated trap function, a challenging benchmark problem that consists of multiple deceptive subfunctions.

240, TITLE: Towards Explainable Evolution Strategies with Large Language Models
AUTHORS: Jill Baumann ; Oliver Kramer
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces an approach that integrates self-adaptive Evolution Strategies (ES) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the explainability of complex optimization processes.

241, TITLE: Evaluating Deep Neural Networks in Deployment (A Comparative and Replicability Study)
AUTHORS: Eduard Pinconschi ; Divya Gopinath ; Rui Abreu ; Corina S. Pasareanu
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we provide a comparative and replicability study on recent approaches that have been proposed to evaluate the reliability of DNNs in deployment.

242, TITLE: Programming Language Case Studies Can Be Deep
AUTHORS: Rose Bohrer
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper argues for disentangling the idea of a tour-of-languages from the tour-of-paradigms. We make this argument by presenting, in depth, a series of case studies included in the Human-Centered Programming Languages curriculum.

243, TITLE: Functional Programming in Learning Electromagnetic Theory
AUTHORS: Scott N. Walck
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.MS]
HIGHLIGHT: This article describes what functional programming has to offer to physics in general, and electromagnetic theory in particular.

244, TITLE: Teaching Type Systems Implementation with Stella, An Extensible Statically Typed Programming Language
AUTHORS: Abdelrahman Abounegm ; Nikolai Kudasov ; Alexey Stepanov
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.SE, K.3.2; D.3.4]
HIGHLIGHT: We report on a half-semester course focused around implementation of type systems in programming languages.

245, TITLE: Mover Logic: A Concurrent Program Logic for Reduction and Rely-Guarantee Reasoning (Extended Version)
AUTHORS: Cormac Flanagan ; Stephen N. Freund
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: Unfortunately, RG logic requires each function postcondition to be "stabilized" or specialized to the behavior of other threads, making it difficult to write function specifications that are reusable at multiple call sites. This paper presents mover logic, which extends RG logic to address this problem via the notion of atomic functions.

246, TITLE: Towards Interpretable Foundation Models of Robot Behavior: A Task Specific Policy Generation Approach
AUTHORS: Isaac Sheidlower ; Reuben Aronson ; Elaine Schaertl Short
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We present an alternative approach to the design of robot foundation models, Diffusion for Policy Parameters (DPP), which generates stand-alone, task-specific policies.

247, TITLE: Adversarial-MidiBERT: Symbolic Music Understanding Model Based on Unbias Pre-training and Mask Fine-tuning
AUTHORS: Zijian Zhao
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: It also has a significant influence on the performance of downstream tasks, which also happens in SMU. To address this challenge, we propose Adversarial-MidiBERT, a symbolic music understanding model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT).

248, TITLE: SPOCKMIP: Segmentation of Vessels in MRAs with Enhanced Continuity Using Maximum Intensity Projection As Loss
AUTHORS: CHETHAN RADHAKRISHNA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.LG, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: Two methods are proposed with the incorporation of MIPs of label segmentation on the single~(z-axis) and multiple perceivable axes of the 3D volume.

249, TITLE: Ethics of Generating Synthetic MRI Vocal Tract Views from The Face
AUTHORS: Muhammad Suhaib Shahid ; Gleb E. Yakubov ; Andrew P. French
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: E2ICM utilises facial movements to infer internal configurations and provides a cost-effective supporting technology for MRI. In this preliminary work, we employ Pix2PixGAN to generate pseudo-MRI views from external articulatory data, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach.

250, TITLE: GUI-based Pedicle Screw Planning on Fluoroscopic Images Utilizing Vertebral Segmentation
AUTHORS: Vivek Maik ; Aparna Purayath ; Durga R ; Manojkumar Lakshmanan ; Mohanasankar Sivaprakasm
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In situations where efficiency and cost-effectiveness are paramount, planning to utilize fluoroscopic images acquired for image registration emerges as the optimal choice. The methodology proposed in this study employs a simulated 3D pedicle screw to calculate its coronal and sagittal projections for pedicle screw planning using anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral (LP) images.

251, TITLE: Histopathological Image Classification with Cell Morphology Aware Deep Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Andrey Ignatov ; Josephine Yates ; Valentina Boeva
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT: Such models, however, usually require extensive annotated datasets for training, which is often not the case in the considered task, where the number of available patient data samples is very limited. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel DeepCMorph model pre-trained to learn cell morphology and identify a large number of different cancer types.
