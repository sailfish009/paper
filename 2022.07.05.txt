This paper proposes a semantic segmentation network, termed DeepPyramid, that can deal with these challenges using three novelties: (1) a Pyramid View Fusion module which provides a varying-angle global view of the surrounding region centering at each pixel position in the input convolutional feature map; (2) a Deformable Pyramid Reception module which enables a wide deformable receptive field that can adapt to geometric transformations in the object of interest; and (3) a dedicated Pyramid Loss that adaptively supervises multi-scale semantic feature maps.

207, TITLE: Counterbalancing Teacher: Regularizing Batch Normalized Models for Robustness
AUTHORS: SAEID ASGARI TAGHANAKI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, we demonstrate that BN comes with a fundamental drawback: it incentivizes the model to rely on low-variance features that are highly specific to the training (in-domain) data, hurting generalization performance on out-of-domain examples. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon by first showing that removing BN layers across a wide range of architectures leads to lower out-of-domain and corruption errors at the cost of higher in-domain errors.

AUTHORS: Kun Wei ; Yike Zhang ; Sining Sun ; Lei Xie ; Long Ma

To avoid this problem, we propose an audio-textual cross-modal representation extractor to learn contextual representations directly from preceding speech.

AUTHORS: Hongyan Xu ; Dadong Wang ; Arcot Sowmya
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Some common deep learning methods that integrate large-scale receptive fields may cause the loss of image detail, resulting in the omission of the region of interest (ROI) in COVID-19 images and are therefore not suitable for further processing. To this end, we propose a deep spatial pyramid pooling (D-SPP) module to integrate contextual information over different resolutions, aiming to extract information under different scales of COVID-19 images effectively.
