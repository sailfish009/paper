Building on these findings, we proposed a novelreinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization(AEPO).

101, TITLE: Consistency Is Not Always Correct: Towards Understanding The Role of Exploration in Post-Training Reasoning
AUTHORS: Dake Bu; Wei Huang; Andi Han; Atsushi Nitanda; Bo Xue; Qingfu Zhang; Hau-San Wong; Taiji Suzuki
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While recent workhighlights the role of exploration and entropy stability in improving pass@K,empirical evidence points to a paradox: RLVR and ORM/PRM typically reinforceexisting tree-like reasoning paths rather than expanding the reasoning scope,raising the question of why exploration helps at all if no new patterns emerge. To reconcile this paradox, we adopt the perspective of Kim et al. (2025),viewing easy (e.g., simplifying a fraction) versus hard (e.g., discovering asymmetry) reasoning steps as low- versus high-probability Markov transitions,and formalize post-training dynamics through Multi-task Tree-structured MarkovChains (TMC).

114, TITLE: HarmoQ: Harmonized Post-Training Quantization for High-Fidelity Image
AUTHORS: Hongjun Wang; Jiyuan Chen; Xuan Song; Yinqiang Zheng
CATEGORY: arxiv-eess.IV [IV]
HIGHLIGHT: Throughcontrolled experiments on SwinIR, we uncover a striking asymmetry: weightquantization primarily degrades structural similarity, while activationquantization disproportionately affects pixel-level accuracy. This stems fromtheir distinct roles--weights encode learned restoration priors for texturesand edges, whereas activations carry input-specific intensity information.Building on this insight, we propose HarmoQ, a unified framework thatharmonizes quantization across components through three synergistic steps:structural residual calibration proactively adjusts weights to compensate foractivation-induced detail loss, harmonized scale optimization analyticallybalances quantization difficulty via closed-form solutions, and adaptiveboundary refinement iteratively maintains this balance during optimization.Experiments show HarmoQ achieves substantial gains under aggressivecompression, outperforming prior art by 0.46 dB on Set5 at 2-bit whiledelivering 3.2x speedup and 4x memory reduction on A100 GPUs.

AUTHORS: Teng Shi; Chenglei Shen; Weijie Yu; Shen Nie; Chongxuan Li; Xiao Zhang; Ming He; Yan Han; Jun Xu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.IR [IR]
HIGHLIGHT: While effective, existing autoregressive models face two intrinsic limitations: (1) unidirectional constraints, where causal attention restricts each token to attend only to its predecessors, hindering global semantic modeling; and (2) error accumulation, where the fixed left-to-right generation order causes prediction errors in early tokens to propagate to the predictions of subsequent token. To address these issues, we propose LLaDA-Rec, a discrete diffusion framework that reformulates recommendation as parallel semantic ID generation.

HIGHLIGHT: However, these models often treat text as flat sequences,limiting their ability to handle complex, compositional, and long-formdescriptions. In particular, they fail to capture two essential properties oflanguage: semantic hierarchy, which reflects the multi-level compositionalstructure of text, and semantic monotonicity, where richer descriptions shouldresult in stronger alignment with visual content.To address these limitations,we propose HiMo-CLIP, a representation-level framework that enhances CLIP-stylemodels without modifying the encoder architecture.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: As a key medium for human interaction and information exchange, socialnetworking services (SNS) pose unique challenges for large language models(LLMs): heterogeneous workloads, fast-shifting norms and slang, andmultilingual, culturally diverse corpora that induce sharp distribution shift.Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can specialize models but often triggers a``seesaw'' between in-distribution gains and out-of-distribution robustness,especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritizedpost-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation.

511, TITLE: ALIGN: A Vision-Language Framework for High-Accuracy Accident Location Inference Through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning
AUTHORS: MD Thamed Bin Zaman Chowdhury; Moazzem Hossain
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Reliable geospatial information on road accidents is vital for safetyanalysis and infrastructure planning, yet most low- and middle-income countriescontinue to face a critical shortage of accurate, location-specific crash data.Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual andunstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixedBangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations,this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-SpatialNeural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatialreasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-basedcues.
