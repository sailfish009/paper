91, TITLE: DASEE A Synthetic Database of Domestic Acoustic Scenes and Events in Dementia Patients Environment
AUTHORS: Abigail Copiaco ; Christian Ritz ; Stefano Fasciani ; Nidhal Abdulaziz
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.SD, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we detail our approach on generating an unbiased synthetic domestic audio database, consisting of sound scenes and events, emulated in both quiet and noisy environments. As a result, we present an 11-class database containing excerpts of clean and noisy signals at 5-seconds duration each, uniformly sampled at 16 kHz.

92, TITLE: IDMT-Traffic: An Open Benchmark Dataset for Acoustic Traffic Monitoring Research
AUTHORS: JAKOB ABESSER et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present a novel open benchmark dataset, containing 2.5 hours of stereo audio recordings of 4718 vehicle passing events captured with both high-quality sE8 and medium-quality MEMS microphones.

93, TITLE: LambdaUNet: 2.5D Stroke Lesion Segmentation of Diffusion-weighted MR Images
AUTHORS: YANGLAN OU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To tackle this problem, we propose a new neural network architecture tailored for segmenting highly-discontinuous 2.5D data such as DWIs.

94, TITLE: Deep Learning Body Region Classification of MRI and CT Examinations
AUTHORS: PHILIPPE RAFFY et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We show that deep learning models can classify CT and MRI images by body region including lower and upper extremities with high accuracy.

AUTHORS: Shiba Kuanar ; Vassilis Athitsos ; Dwarikanath Mahapatra ; Anand Rajan
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based detection model for cell classification on IHC stained histology images.

96, TITLE: Image Synthesis As A Pretext for Unsupervised Histopathological Diagnosis
AUTHORS: Dejan Stepec ; Danijel Skocaj
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work we evaluate a crucial part of the unsupervised visual anomaly detection pipeline, that is needed for normal appearance modeling, as well as the ability to reconstruct closest looking normal and tumor samples.

97, TITLE: Deep Two-Stage High-Resolution Image Inpainting
AUTHORS: Andrey Moskalenko ; Mikhail Erofeev ; Dmitriy Vatolin
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this article, we propose a method that solves the problem of inpainting arbitrary-size images.

98, TITLE: Unsupervised Detection of Cancerous Regions in Histology Imagery Using Image-to-Image Translation
AUTHORS: Dejan Stepec ; Danijel Skocaj
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we present an image-to-image translation-based framework that significantly surpasses the performance of existing unsupervised methods and approaches the performance of supervised methods in a challenging domain of cancerous region detection in histology imagery.

99, TITLE: Recent Advances on Non-Line-of-Sight Imaging: Conventional Physical Models, Deep Learning, and New Scenes
