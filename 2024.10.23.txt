34, TITLE: Towards Reliable Evaluation of Behavior Steering Interventions in LLMs
AUTHORS: Itamar Pres ; Laura Ruis ; Ekdeep Singh Lubana ; David Krueger
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We aim to take a step towards addressing this issue by advocating for four properties missing from current evaluations: (i) contexts sufficiently similar to downstream tasks should be used for assessing intervention quality; (ii) model likelihoods should be accounted for; (iii) evaluations should allow for standardized comparisons across different target behaviors; and (iv) baseline comparisons should be offered. We introduce an evaluation pipeline grounded in these criteria, offering both a quantitative and visual analysis of how effectively a given method works.

We derive coreference chains from a corpus of 30 million biomedical abstracts and construct a graph based on the string phrases within these chains, establishing connections between phrases if they co-occur within the same coreference chain.

To tackle these problems, this paper proposes an Atomic fact decomposition-based Retrieval and Editing (ARE) framework, which decomposes the generated long-form answers into molecular clauses and atomic facts by the instruction-tuned LLMs.

CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: When dealing with right-censored data, where some outcomes are missing due to a limited observation period, survival analysis -- known as time-to-event analysis -- focuses on predicting the time until an event of interest occurs.

236, TITLE: Can A Machine Distinguish High and Low Amount of Social Creak in Speech?
AUTHORS: Anne-Maria Laukkanen ; Sudarsana Reddy Kadiri ; Shrikanth Narayanan ; Paavo Alku
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: The classification systems reported in this study could be considered as baselines in future ML-based studies on social creak.

237, TITLE: NucleiMix: Realistic Data Augmentation for Nuclei Instance Segmentation
AUTHORS: Jiamu Wang ; Jin Tae Kwak
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The release of several public datasets has significantly advanced research in this area, yet many existing methods struggle with data imbalance issues. To address this challenge, this study introduces a data augmentation method, called NucleiMix, which is designed to balance the distribution of nuclei types by increasing the number of rare-type nuclei within datasets.
