170, TITLE: Audio-visual Fine-tuning of Audio-only ASR Models
AUTHORS: Avner May ; Dmitriy Serdyuk ; Ankit Parag Shah ; Otavio Braga ; Olivier Siohan
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: Recently, audio-visual self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches have been developed to reduce this dependence on transcribed AV data, but these methods are quite complex and computationally expensive. In this work, we propose replacing these expensive AV-SSL methods with a simple and fast \textit{audio-only} SSL method, and then performing AV supervised fine-tuning.

171, TITLE: IR-UWB Radar-Based Contactless Silent Speech Recognition of Vowels, Consonants, Words, and Phrases
AUTHORS: Sunghwa Lee ; Younghoon Shin ; Myungjong Kim ; Jiwon Seo
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: Several sensing techniques have been proposed for silent speech recognition (SSR); however, many of these methods require invasive processes or sensor attachment to the skin using adhesive tape or glue, rendering them unsuitable for frequent use in daily life.

172, TITLE: Fine-Tuned Self-Supervised Speech Representations for Language Diarization in Multilingual Code-Switched Speech
AUTHORS: Geoffrey Frost ; Emily Morris ; Joshua Jansen van V�ren ; Thomas Niesler
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: It would be useful if the spoken languages in an utterance and the boundaries thereof were known before annotation commences, to allow segments to be assigned to the relevant language experts in parallel. To address this, we investigate the development of a continuous multilingual language diarizer using fine-tuned speech representations extracted from a large pre-trained self-supervised architecture (WavLM).

CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the lack of understanding of such architectural priors results in superfluous design choices and sub-optimal outcomes. This work aims to simplify the architectural design decisions for DIP-MRI to facilitate its practical deployment.

176, TITLE: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Joint Cruise Control and Intelligent Data Acquisition in UAVs-Assisted Sensor Networks
AUTHORS: Yousef Emami
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI, cs.NI]
HIGHLIGHT: Our proposal to address this challenge is to minimize packet loss by jointly optimizing the velocity controls and data collection schedules of multiple UAVs.Furthermore, in UASNets, swift movements of UAVs result in poor channel conditions and fast signal attenuation, leading to an extended age of information (AoI). In contrast, slow movements of UAVs prolong flight time, thereby extending the AoI of ground sensors.To address this challenge, we propose a new mean-field flight resource allocation optimization to minimize the AoI of sensory data.
