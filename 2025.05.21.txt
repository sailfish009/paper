1, TITLE: EVA: Red-Teaming GUI Agents Via Evolving Indirect Prompt Injection
AUTHORS: YIJIE LU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: A typical example is environmental injection, in which GUI elements are manipulated to influence agent behavior without directly modifying the user prompt. To address these emerging attacks, we propose EVA, a red teaming framework for indirect prompt injection which transforms the attack into a closed loop optimization by continuously monitoring an agent's attention distribution over the GUI and updating adversarial cues, keywords, phrasing, and layout, in response.

To address this issue, we propose a novel data annotation method for PRMs specifically designed to score the long CoT reasoning process.

3, TITLE: Unearthing Gems from Stones: Policy Optimization with Negative Sample Augmentation for LLM Reasoning
AUTHORS: ZHAOHUI YANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2) consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and 3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps within negative samples.

4, TITLE: Think Only When You Need with Large Hybrid-Reasoning Models
AUTHORS: LINGJIE JIANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]

To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training pipeline comprising Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) as a cold start, followed by online reinforcement learning with the proposed Hybrid Group Policy Optimization (HGPO) to implicitly learn to select the appropriate thinking mode.

To address this gap, we introduce a richer theory of social sycophancy in LLMs, characterizing sycophancy as the excessive preservation of a user's face (the positive self-image a person seeks to maintain in an interaction).

AUTHORS: Soumya Rani Samineni ; Durgesh Kalwar ; Karthik Valmeekam ; Kaya Stechly ; Subbarao Kambhampati
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: The two critical structural assumptions include (1) making the MDP states be just a concatenation of the actions-with states becoming the context window and the actions becoming the tokens in LLMs and (2) splitting the reward of a state-action trajectory uniformly across the trajectory. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that these simplifying assumptions make the approach effectively equivalent to an outcome-driven supervised learning.

21, TITLE: Power Lines: Scaling Laws for Weight Decay and Batch Size in LLM Pre-training
AUTHORS: SHANE BERGSMA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We study scaling laws for HPs: formulas for how to scale HPs as we scale model size N, dataset size D, and batch size B. Recent work suggests the AdamW timescale, B/({\eta}{\lambda}D), should remain constant across training settings, and we verify the implication that optimal {\lambda} scales linearly with B, for a fixed N,D. However, as N,D scale, we show the optimal timescale obeys a precise power law in the tokens-per-parameter ratio, D/N. This law thus provides a method to accurately predict {\lambda}opt in advance of large-scale training.

AUTHORS: Andrei Manolache ; Luiz F. O. Chamon ; Mathias Niepert
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Even when the data is fully symmetric, enforcing equivariance can hurt training by limiting the model to a restricted region of the parameter space. Guided by homotopy principles, where an optimization problem is solved by gradually transforming a simpler problem into a complex one, we introduce Adaptive Constrained Equivariance (ACE), a constrained optimization approach that starts with a flexible, non-equivariant model and gradually reduces its deviation from equivariance.

AUTHORS: Yunlong Liang ; Fandong Meng ; Jie Zhou
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, there exist two limitations in current MoE solutions which may lead to sub-optimal performance: 1) they directly use the task knowledge of NMT into MoE (\emph{e.g.}, domain/linguistics-specific knowledge), which are generally unavailable at practical application and neglect the naturally grouped domain/linguistic properties; 2) the expert selection only depends on the localized token representation without considering the context, which fully grasps the state of each token in a global view. To address the above limitations, we propose THOR-MoE via arming the MoE with hierarchical task-guided and context-responsive routing policies.

359, TITLE: SuperMapNet for Long-Range and High-Accuracy Vectorized HD Map Construction
AUTHORS: Ruqin Zhou ; San Jiang ; Wanshou Jiang ; Yongsheng Zhang ; Chenguang Dai
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Remarkable work has been achieved in recent years, but there are still major issues: (1) in the generation of the BEV features, single modality-based methods are of limited perception capability, while direct concatenation-based multi-modal methods fail to capture synergies and disparities between different modalities, resulting in limited ranges with feature holes; (2) in the classification and localization of map elements, only point information is used without the consideration of element infor-mation and neglects the interaction between point information and element information, leading to erroneous shapes and element entanglement with low accuracy. To address above issues, we introduce SuperMapNet for long-range and high-accuracy vectorized HD map construction.

384, TITLE: Textual Steering Vectors Can Improve Visual Understanding in Multimodal Large Language Models
AUTHORS: WOODY HAOSHENG GAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), however, do not currently enjoy the same suite of techniques, due in part to their recency and architectural diversity. Inspired by this gap, we investigate whether MLLMs can be steered using vectors derived from their text-only LLM backbone, via sparse autoencoders (SAEs), mean shift, and linear probing.

AUTHORS: KARINA ZAINULLINA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We investigate two complementary search strategies applicable to such environments: 1-step lookahead and trajectory selection, both guided by a learned action-value function estimator. On the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, a key testbed for agentic software engineering, we find these methods to double the average success rate of a fine-tuned Qwen-72B model, achieving 40.8%, the new state-of-the-art for open-weights models.
