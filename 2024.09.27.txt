HIGHLIGHT: However, these methods suffer from two main limitations, which raises concerns about potential vulnerabilities: i) the manipulation detector is not robust to noise and hence can be easily fooled; ii) the fact that they rely on fixed perturbations for image protection offers a predictable exploit for malicious attackers, enabling them to reverse-engineer and evade detection. To overcome this issue we propose PADL, a new solution able to generate image-specific perturbations using a symmetric scheme of encoding and decoding based on cross-attention, which drastically reduces the possibility of reverse engineering, even when evaluated with adaptive attack [31].
