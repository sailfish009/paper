CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the origin of this neural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model size -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs represent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e., representations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur with varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss scaling with model size.

To address this, we propose a temporal Inhibitory Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ILIF) neuron model, inspired by biological inhibitory mechanisms.
