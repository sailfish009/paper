In this paper, we argue that non-binary treatment decisions are integral to the decision process and controlled by decision-makers and, therefore, should be central to fairness analyses in algorithmic decision-making.

HIGHLIGHT: It is generally difficult to quantitatively and authoritatively evaluate the quality of synthetic images; however, in mission-critical biomedical scenarios robust evaluation is paramount. In this work, all practical image-to-image comparisons really are relative qualifications, not absolute difference quantifications; and, therefore, meaningful evaluation of generated image quality can be accomplished using the Tversky Index, which is a well-established measure for assessing perceptual similarity.
