AUTHORS: Pengfei Hu; Meng Cao; Yingyao Wang; Yi Wang; Jiahua Dong; Jun Song; Yu Cheng; Bo Zheng; Xiaodan Liang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While the emerging thinking-with-frames paradigm, which alternates between global temporal reasoning and local frame examination, has advanced the reasoning capabilities of video multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), it suffers from a significant efficiency bottleneck due to the progressively growing and redundant multi-modal context. To address this, we propose SpecTemp, a reinforcement learning-based Speculative Temporal reasoning framework that decouples temporal perception from reasoning via a cooperative dual-model design.

AUTHORS: Chenyi Wang; Yanmao Man; Raymond Muller; Ming Li; Z. Berkay Celik; Ryan Gerdes; Jonathan Petit
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Previous attacks against MOT either focused on hijacking the trackers of individual objects, or manipulating the tracker IDs in MOT by attacking the integrated object detection (OD) module in the digital domain, which are model-specific, non-robust, and only able to affect specific samples in offline datasets. In this paper, we present AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack against tracking-by-detection MOT, in which an attacker uses adversarial trajectories to transfer its ID to a targeted object to confuse the tracking system, without attacking OD.

AUTHORS: Chengzhi Yu; Yifan Xu; Yifan Chen; Wenyi Zhang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, principled hallucination mitigation remains a critical challenge.In this work, we first analyze the data generation process in LVLM hallucination mitigation and affirm that on-policy data significantly outperforms off-policy data, which thus calls for efficient and reliable preference annotation of on-policy data. We then point out that, existing annotation methods introduce additional hallucination in training samples, which may enhance the model's hallucination patterns, to address this problem, we propose training a hallucination classifier giving binary annotations, which guarantee clean chosen samples for the subsequent alignment.

443, TITLE: Gradient Inversion in Federated Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Shenghong He
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) enables distributed learning of optimal policies while preserving local data privacy through gradient sharing.However, FRL faces the risk of data privacy leaks, where attackers exploit shared gradients to reconstruct local training data.Compared to traditional supervised federated learning, successful reconstruction in FRL requires the generated data not only to match the shared gradients but also to align with real transition dynamics of the environment (i.e., aligning with the real data transition distribution). To address this issue, we propose a novel attack method called Regularization Gradient Inversion Attack (RGIA), which enforces prior-knowledge-based regularization on states, rewards, and transition dynamics during the optimization process to ensure that the reconstructed data remain close to the true transition distribution.Theoretically, we prove that the prior-knowledge-based regularization term narrows the solution space from a broad set containing spurious solutions to a constrained subset that satisfies both gradient matching and true transition dynamics.Extensive experiments on control tasks and autonomous driving tasks demonstrate that RGIA can effectively constrain reconstructed data transition distributions and thus successfully reconstruct local private data.

499, TITLE: Probabilistic Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning for Sparse Historical Data: A Framework Integrating Bayesian Inference, Causal Models, and Game-Theoretic Allocation
AUTHORS: Saba Kublashvili
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Modeling historical events poses fundamental challenges for machine learning: extreme data scarcity (N << 100), heterogeneous and noisy measurements, missing counterfactuals, and the requirement for human interpretable explanations. We present HistoricalML, a probabilistic neuro-symbolic framework that addresses these challenges through principled integration of (1) Bayesian uncertainty quantification to separate epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty, (2) structural causal models for counterfactual reasoning under confounding, (3) cooperative game theory (Shapley values) for fair allocation modeling, and (4) attention based neural architectures for context dependent factor weighting.

665, TITLE: HERMES: Heterogeneous Application-Enabled Routing Middleware for Edge-IoT Systems
AUTHORS: Jéssica Consciência; António Grilo
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.NI [NI]
HIGHLIGHT: This trend, however, exposes challenges, as the heterogeneity of devices and the complex requirements of applications are often misaligned with the assumptions of traditional routing protocols, which lack the flexibility to accommodate application-layer metrics and policies. This work addresses this gap by proposing a software framework that enhances routing flexibility by dynamically incorporating application-aware decisions.

666, TITLE: Revisiting Direct Encoding: Learnable Temporal Dynamics for Static Image Spiking Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Huaxu He
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.NE [NE]
HIGHLIGHT: This work revisits the reported performance gap between direct and rate based encodings and shows that it primarily stems from convolutional learnability and surrogate gradient formulations rather than the encoding schemes themselves. To illustrate this mechanism level clarification, we introduce a minimal learnable temporal encoding that adds adaptive phase shifts to induce meaningful temporal variation from static inputs.

671, TITLE: Fast, Robust, Permutation-and-Sign Invariant SO(3) Pattern Alignment
AUTHORS: Anik Sarker; Alan T. Asbeck
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.RO [RO]
HIGHLIGHT: Our key idea is to decompose each rotation into its \emph{Transformed Basis Vectors} (TBVs)-three unit vectors on \(S^2\)-and align the resulting spherical point sets per axis using fast, robust matchers (SPMC, FRS, and a hybrid). To handle axis relabels and sign flips, we introduce a \emph{Permutation-and-Sign Invariant} (PASI) wrapper that enumerates the 24 proper signed permutations, scores them via summed correlations, and fuses the per-axis estimates into a single rotation by projection/Karcher mean.
