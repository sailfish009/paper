In answering this question, we propose Video Adapter, which leverages the score function of a large pretrained video diffusion model as a probabilistic prior to guide the generation of a task-specific small video model.

HIGHLIGHT: This kind of human coding forms an important part of social science research, yet the coding process is both resource intensive and highly variable from application to application. In some cases, efforts to automate this process have achieved human-level accuracies, but to achieve this, these attempts frequently rely on thousands of hand-labeled training examples, which makes them inapplicable to small-scale research studies and costly for large ones.

AUTHORS: Oriol Nieto ; Zeyu Jin ; Franck Dernoncourt ; Justin Salamon
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: For real-world deployment, a model should also gracefully handle unseen languages outside of the target language set, yet prior work has focused on closed-set classification where all input languages are known a-priori. In this paper we address these two limitations: we explore efficient model architectures for SLR based on convolutional networks, and propose a multilabel training strategy to handle non-target languages at inference time.

AUTHORS: Fengzhu Zeng ; Wei Gao
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Little attention has been paid on \underline{EA}rly \underline{R}umor \underline{D}etection (EARD), and EARD performance was evaluated inappropriately on a few datasets where the actual early-stage information is largely missing. To reverse such situation, we construct BEARD, a new \underline{B}enchmark dataset for \underline{EARD}, based on claims from fact-checking websites by trying to gather as many early relevant posts as possible.

To address this problem, we propose a framework of graph-aware language model pre-training (GALM) on a large graph corpus, which incorporates large language models and graph neural networks, and a variety of fine-tuning methods on downstream applications.

AUTHORS: Lea Frermann ; Jiatong Li ; Shima Khanehzar ; Gosia Mikolajczak
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite increasing interest in the automatic detection of media frames in NLP, the problem is typically simplified as single-label classification and adopts a topic-like view on frames, evading modelling the broader document-level narrative. In this work, we revisit a widely used conceptualization of framing from the communication sciences which explicitly captures elements of narratives, including conflict and its resolution, and integrate it with the narrative framing of key entities in the story as heroes, victims or villains.

To address this accuracy issue, we introduce the Sparse-Quantized Representation (SpQR), a new compressed format and quantization technique which enables for the first time near-lossless compression of LLMs across model scales, while reaching similar compression levels to previous methods.

88, TITLE: Extract and Attend: Improving Entity Translation in Neural Machine Translation
AUTHORS: ZIXIN ZENG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]

AUTHORS: JIARUI ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Whereas prior work has provided benchmarks and methods for traffic monitoring, it remains unclear whether models can effectively align these information sources and reason in novel scenarios.

AUTHORS: YUKANG LIANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, eess.AS]

111, TITLE: On "Scientific Debt" in NLP: A Case for More Rigour in Language Model Pre-Training Research
AUTHORS: MADE NINDYATAMA NITYASYA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite rapid recent progress afforded by increasingly better pre-trained language models (PLMs), current PLM research practices often conflate different possible sources of model improvement, without conducting proper ablation studies and principled comparisons between different models under comparable conditions. These practices (i) leave us ill-equipped to understand which pre-training approaches should be used under what circumstances; (ii) impede reproducibility and credit assignment; and (iii) render it difficult to understand: "How exactly does each factor contribute to the progress that we have today?"

112, TITLE: DecompX: Explaining Transformers Decisions By Propagating Token Decomposition
AUTHORS: Ali Modarressi ; Mohsen Fayyaz ; Ehsan Aghazadeh ; Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh ; Mohammad Taher Pilehvar

In this paper, we present DecompX to tackle these challenges.

In this new era of LLMs, we must develop and design approaches to transparency by considering the needs of stakeholders in the emerging LLM ecosystem, the novel types of LLM-infused applications being built, and the new usage patterns and challenges around LLMs, all while building on lessons learned about how people process, interact with, and make use of information.

HIGHLIGHT: However, it is still an open question to build a factor model that can conduct stock prediction in an online and adaptive setting, where the model can adapt itself to match the current market regime identified based on only point-in-time market information. To tackle this problem, we propose the first deep learning based online and adaptive factor model, HireVAE, at the core of which is a hierarchical latent space that embeds the underlying relationship between the market situation and stock-wise latent factors, so that HireVAE can effectively estimate useful latent factors given only historical market information and subsequently predict accurate stock returns.

314, TITLE: Data-Driven Regret Balancing for Online Model Selection in Bandits
AUTHORS: Aldo Pacchiano ; Christoph Dann ; Claudio Gentile
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: The meta-learner is therefore able to leverage the realized regret incurred by each base learner for the learning environment at hand (as opposed to the expected regret), and single out the best such regret. We design two model selection algorithms operating with this more ambitious notion of regret and, besides proving model selection guarantees via regret balancing, we experimentally demonstrate the compelling practical benefits of dealing with actual regrets instead of candidate regret bounds.

322, TITLE: (Un)reasonable Allure of Ante-hoc Interpretability for High-stakes Domains: Transparency Is Necessary But Insufficient for Explainability
AUTHORS: Kacper Sokol ; Julia E. Vogt
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Additionally, its distinction from the less desirable post-hoc explainability, which refers to methods that construct a separate explanatory model, is vague given that transparent predictors may still require (post-)processing to yield satisfactory explanatory insights. Ante-hoc interpretability is thus an overloaded concept that comprises a range of implicit properties, which we unpack in this paper to better understand what is needed for its safe deployment across high-stakes domains.

HIGHLIGHT: While both of these requirements ensure that the steps of the journey as well as its destination are admissible, current literature neglects the multiplicity of such counterfactual paths. To address this shortcoming we introduce the novel concept of explanatory multiverse that encompasses all the possible counterfactual journeys and shows how to navigate, reason about and compare the geometry of these paths -- their affinity, branching, divergence and possible future convergence -- with two methods: vector spaces and graphs.
