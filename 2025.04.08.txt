AUTHORS: QUAN SHI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: As language models achieve increasingly human-like capabilities in conversational text generation, a critical question emerges: to what extent can these systems simulate the characteristics of specific individuals? To evaluate this, we introduce IMPersona, a framework for evaluating LMs at impersonating specific individuals' writing style and personal knowledge.

2, TITLE: Video-Bench: Human-Aligned Video Generation Benchmark
AUTHORS: HUI HAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main categories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to evaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack alignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based benchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a limited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency. To address these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with human preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions.

7, TITLE: Among Us: A Sandbox for Agentic Deception
AUTHORS: Satvik Golechha ; Adri� Garriga-Alonso
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.LG]

AUTHORS: Wang Tang ; Fethiye Irmak Dogan ; Linbo Qing ; Hatice Gunes
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.MM]
HIGHLIGHT: Current computational methods for modeling these relationships face three major challenges: (1) the failure to model asymmetric relationships, e.g., one individual may perceive the other as a friend while the other perceives them as an acquaintance, (2) the disruption of continuous interactions by discrete frame sampling, which segments the temporal continuity of interaction in real-world scenarios, and (3) the limitation to consider periodic behavioral cues, such as rhythmic vocalizations or recurrent gestures, which are crucial for inferring the evolution of dyadic relationships. To address these challenges, we propose AsyReC, a multimodal graph-based framework for asymmetric dyadic relationship classification, with three core innovations: (i) a triplet graph neural network with node-edge dual attention that dynamically weights multimodal cues to capture interaction asymmetries (addressing challenge 1); (ii) a clip-level relationship learning architecture that preserves temporal continuity, enabling fine-grained modeling of real-world interaction dynamics (addressing challenge 2); and (iii) a periodic temporal encoder that projects time indices onto sine/cosine waveforms to model recurrent behavioral patterns (addressing challenge 3).

AUTHORS: Kidist Amde Mekonnen ; Yubao Tang ; Maarten de Rijke

HIGHLIGHT: While reinforcement learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning from relevance feedback (RLRF), aim to address this misalignment through reward modeling, they introduce significant complexity, requiring the optimization of an auxiliary reward function followed by reinforcement fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and often unstable. To address these challenges, we propose direct document relevance optimization (DDRO), which aligns token-level docid generation with document-level relevance estimation through direct optimization via pairwise ranking, eliminating the need for explicit reward modeling and reinforcement learning.
