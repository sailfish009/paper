246, TITLE: Embarassingly Simple Dataset Distillation
AUTHORS: Feng Yunzhen ; Vedantam Ramakrishna ; Kempe Julia
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML]

AUTHORS: LUCA LACH et. al.

We therefore present a simulation environment that produces realistic normal forces, which we use to train continuous force control policies.
