HIGHLIGHT: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) is a recent but already widely popular method that relies on an image diffusion model to control optimization problems using text prompts. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the SDS loss function, identify an inherent problem with its formulation, and propose a surprisingly easy but effective fix.

81, TITLE: SnapCap: Efficient Snapshot Compressive Video Captioning
AUTHORS: JIANQIAO SUN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, in such a pipeline, some potential shortcomings are inevitable, i.e., information redundancy resulting in low efficiency and information loss during the sampling process for captioning. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel VC pipeline to generate captions directly from the compressed measurement, which can be captured by a snapshot compressive sensing camera and we dub our model SnapCap.

82, TITLE: Diffusion-based Pose Refinement and Muti-hypothesis Generation for 3D Human Pose Estimaiton
AUTHORS: HONGBO KANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Compared to deterministic models, the excessive uncertainty in probabilistic models leads to weaker performance in single-hypothesis prediction. To address these two challenges, we propose a diffusion-based refinement framework called DRPose, which refines the output of deterministic models by reverse diffusion and achieves more suitable multi-hypothesis prediction for the current pose benchmark by multi-step refinement with multiple noises.

83, TITLE: Refining Remote Photoplethysmography Architectures Using CKA and Empirical Methods
AUTHORS: Nathan Vance ; Patrick Flynn
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We apply Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to an array of rPPG architectures of differing depths, demonstrating that shallower models do not learn the same representations as deeper models, and that after a certain depth, redundant layers are added without significantly increased functionality. An empirical study confirms these findings and shows how this method could be used to refine rPPG architectures.

85, TITLE: Watermark Text Pattern Spotting in Document Images
AUTHORS: Mateusz Krubinski ; Stefan Matcovici ; Diana Grigore ; Daniel Voinea ; Alin-Ionut Popa
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Stemming from the problem of text spotting, detecting and understanding watermarks in documents inherits the same hardships - in the wild, writing can come in various fonts, sizes and forms, making generic recognition a very difficult problem. To address the lack of resources in this field and propel further research, we propose a novel benchmark (K-Watermark) containing 65,447 data samples generated using Wrender, a watermark text patterns rendering procedure.
