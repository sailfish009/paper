In this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect meaningful model representations.

9, TITLE: PredGen: Accelerated Inference of Large Language Models Through Input-Time Speculation for Real-Time Speech Interaction
AUTHORS: Shufan Li ; Aditya Grover
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.SD, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time.

10, TITLE: Context-Informed Grounding Supervision
AUTHORS: HYUNJI LEE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, prior work has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context.

CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While many studies on LID model training focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue to perform poorly.

HIGHLIGHT: Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning.

26, TITLE: Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding Via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction
AUTHORS: Marija ?akota ; Robert West
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: This is advantageous as it allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model $M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions.

These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).
