163, TITLE: Three Decades of Activations: A Comprehensive Survey of 400 Activation Functions for Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Vladimï¿½r Kunc ; Ji?ï¿½ Klï¿½ma
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.NE, I.5.1]
HIGHLIGHT: The absence of this overview, even in our experience, leads to redundancy and the unintentional rediscovery of already existing activation functions. To bridge this gap, our paper presents an extensive survey involving 400 activation functions, which is several times larger in scale than previous surveys.

164, TITLE: Intelligent Agricultural Management Considering N$_2$O Emission and Climate Variability with Uncertainties
AUTHORS: Zhaoan Wang ; Shaoping Xiao ; Jun Wang ; Ashwin Parab ; Shivam Patel
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CY]
HIGHLIGHT: Our research tackles uncertainties in N$_2$O emission estimates with a probabilistic ML approach and climate variability through a stochastic weather model, offering a range of emission outcomes to improve forecast reliability and decision-making.

165, TITLE: Embracing The Black Box: Heading Towards Foundation Models for Causal Discovery from Time Series Data
AUTHORS: Gideon Stein ; Maha Shadaydeh ; Joachim Denzler
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, 68T07]
HIGHLIGHT: However, these methods typically do not endorse one of the most prevalent paradigms in deep learning: End-to-end learning. To address this gap, we explore what we call Causal Pretraining.

166, TITLE: Blind Deep-Learning-Based Image Watermarking Robust Against Geometric Transformations
AUTHORS: Hannes Mareen ; Lucas Antchougov ; Glenn Van Wallendael ; Peter Lambert
CATEGORY: cs.MM [cs.MM, cs.CR, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although existing methods embed watermarks imperceptibly and demonstrate robustness against attacks, they typically lack resilience against geometric transformations. Therefore, this paper proposes a new watermarking method that is robust against geometric attacks.

167, TITLE: The Vienna Architecture Description Language
AUTHORS: SIMON HIMMELBAUER et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: This article introduces VADL, describes the generator techniques in detail and demonstrates the power of the language and the performance of the generators in an empirical evaluation.

168, TITLE: Traj-LIO: A Resilient Multi-LiDAR Multi-IMU State Estimator Through Sparse Gaussian Process
AUTHORS: Xin Zheng ; Jianke Zhu
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: It is challenging for the previous discrete-time and IMU-driven kinematic systems to incorporate multiple asynchronized sensors, which are susceptible to abnormal IMU data. To address these limitations, we introduce a multi-LiDAR multi-IMU state estimator by taking advantage of Gaussian Process (GP) that predicts a non-parametric continuous-time trajectory to capture sensors' spatial-temporal movement with limited control states.

169, TITLE: Investigating Premature Convergence in Co-optimization of Morphology and Control in Evolved Virtual Soft Robots
AUTHORS: Alican Mertan ; Nick Cheney
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Prior work identifies and investigates a major issue with the co-optimization process -- fragile co-adaptation of brain and body resulting in premature convergence of morphology. In this work, we expand the investigation of this phenomenon by comparing learnable controllers with proprioceptive observations and fixed controllers without any observations, whereas in the latter case, we only have the optimization of the morphology.

170, TITLE: Design and Realization of A Benchmarking Testbed for Evaluating Autonomous Platooning Algorithms
AUTHORS: Michael Shaham ; Risha Ranjan ; Engin Kirda ; Taskin Padir
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.MA, cs.SY, eess.SY, math.OC]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces a testbed for evaluating and benchmarking platooning algorithms on 1/10th scale vehicles with onboard sensors.

171, TITLE: ChatGPT Vs LLaMA: Impact, Reliability, and Challenges in Stack Overflow Discussions
AUTHORS: Leuson Da Silva ; Jordan Samhi ; Foutse Khomh
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This way, we aim to (ii) measure user engagement evolution with Stack Overflow over time; (ii) quantify the reliability of LLMs' answers and their potential to replace Stack Overflow in the long term; (iii) identify and understand why LLMs fails; and (iv) compare LLMs together.

172, TITLE: Leveraging Cough Sounds to Optimize Chest X-ray Usage in Low-resource Settings
AUTHORS: ALEXANDER PHILIP et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.LG, q-bio.QM]
HIGHLIGHT: We used prospectively-collected data from 137 patients referred for chest X-ray at the Christian Medical Center and Hospital (CMCH) in Purnia, Bihar, India.

173, TITLE: Pruning Sparse Tensor Neural Networks Enables Deep Learning for 3D Ultrasound Localization Microscopy
AUTHORS: Brice Rauby ; Paul Xing ; Jonathan Porï¿½e ; Maxime Gasse ; Jean Provost
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, I.4.9]
HIGHLIGHT: Herein, we propose to use sparse tensor neural networks to reduce memory usage in 2D and to improve the scaling of the memory requirement for the extension of deep learning architecture to 3D.

174, TITLE: Registration of Longitudinal Spine CTs for Monitoring Lesion Growth
AUTHORS: MALIKA SANHINOVA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper we present a novel method to automatically align longitudinal spine CTs and accurately assess lesion progression.

175, TITLE: DestripeCycleGAN: Stripe Simulation CycleGAN for Unsupervised Infrared Image Destriping
AUTHORS: Shiqi Yang ; Hanlin Qin ; Shuai Yuan ; Xiang Yan ; Hossein Rahmani
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This poses a threat to the effectiveness of the cycle-consistency loss, leading to stripe noise residual in the denoised image. To address the above issue, we present a novel framework for single-frame infrared image destriping, named DestripeCycleGAN.

176, TITLE: Crop and Couple: Cardiac Image Segmentation Using Interlinked Specialist Networks
AUTHORS: Abbas Khan ; Muhammad Asad ; Martin Benning ; Caroline Roney ; Gregory Slabaugh
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a novel strategy that performs segmentation using specialist networks that focus on a single anatomy (left ventricle, right ventricle, or myocardium).
