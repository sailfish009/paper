515, TITLE: Sparse Probabilistic Graph Circuits
AUTHORS: Martin Rektoris ; Milan Pape? ; V�clav ?m�dl ; Tom�? Pevn�
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While recently proposed Probabilistic Graph Circuits (PGCs)address this issue by enabling \emph{tractable} probabilistic inference, theyoperate on dense graph representations with $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ complexity forgraphs with $n$ nodes and \emph{$m$ edges}. To address this scalability issue,we introduce Sparse PGCs, a new class of tractable generative models thatoperate directly on sparse graph representation, reducing the complexity to$\mathcal{O}(n + m)$, which is particularly beneficial for $m \ll n^2$.

516, TITLE: Segmented Confidence Sequences and Multi-Scale Adaptive Confidence Segments for Anomaly Detection in Nonstationary Time Series
AUTHORS: Muyan Anna Li ; Aditi Gautam
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, 14J60 (Primary) 14F05, 14J26 (Secondary), F.2.2; I.2.0]
HIGHLIGHT: As time series data become increasingly prevalent in domains such asmanufacturing, IT, and infrastructure monitoring, anomaly detection must adaptto nonstationary environments where statistical properties shift over time.Traditional static thresholds are easily rendered obsolete by regime shifts,concept drift, or multi-scale changes. To address these challenges, weintroduce and empirically evaluate two novel adaptive thresholding frameworks:Segmented Confidence Sequences (SCS) and Multi-Scale Adaptive ConfidenceSegments (MACS).

HIGHLIGHT: The corresponding USMcoordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-merfrequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and,paradoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k. Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by UniversalSequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process.The resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguingoutcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity;and 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process convergingtowards a steady state sequence embedding solution.
