192, TITLE: The Landscape of Agentic Reinforcement Learning for LLMs: A Survey
AUTHORS: GUIBIN ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigmshift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This surveyformalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-stepMarkov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: oneorganized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around theirapplications across diverse task domains.
