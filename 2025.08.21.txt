To provide an effective solutionfor Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for futurestudies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN,which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and usesa k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space.
