HIGHLIGHT: In recent years, querying semantic web data using SPARQL has remainedchallenging, especially for non-expert users, due to the language's complexsyntax and the prerequisite of understanding intricate data structures. Toaddress these challenges, we propose InteracSPARQL, an interactive SPARQL querygeneration and refinement system that leverages natural language explanations(NLEs) to enhance user comprehension and facilitate iterative query refinement.InteracSPARQL integrates LLMs with a rule-based approach to first producestructured explanations directly from SPARQL abstract syntax trees (ASTs),followed by LLM-based linguistic refinements.
