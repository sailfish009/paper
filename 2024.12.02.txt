AUTHORS: KIM-CELINE KAHL et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, we demonstrate that current setups fail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations, limiting their ability to accurately assess model robustness. To address this gap, our work introduces a novel framework, called SURE-VQA, centered around three key requirements to overcome the current pitfalls and systematically analyze the robustness of VLMs: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily translate to real-world shifts, robustness should be measured on real-world shifts that are inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail to capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models (LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks interpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines should be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM.

151, TITLE: LUMIA: Linear Probing for Unimodal and MultiModal Membership Inference A!acks Leveraging Internal LLM States
AUTHORS: Luis Ibanez-Lissen ; Lorena Gonzalez-Manzano ; Jose Maria de Fuentes ; Nicolas Anciaux ; Joaquin Garcia-Alfaro
CATEGORY: cs.CR [cs.CR, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Previous efforts focus on black-to-grey-box models, thus neglecting the potential benefit from internal LLM information. To address this, we propose the use of Linear Probes (LPs) as a method to detect Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) by examining internal activations of LLMs.

156, TITLE: Amplifying Human Performance in Combinatorial Competitive Programming
AUTHORS: PETAR VELI?KOVI? et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE, cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: Here we instead focus on combinatorial competitive programming, where the target is to find as-good-as-possible solutions to otherwise computationally intractable problems, over specific given inputs.

157, TITLE: An Adversarial Learning Approach to Irregular Time-Series Forecasting
AUTHORS: Heejeong Nam ; Jihyun Kim ; Jimin Yeom
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: These problems result in forecasts that often misalign with human intuition. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adversarial learning framework with a deep analysis of adversarial components.

158, TITLE: Towards Class-wise Robustness Analysis
AUTHORS: Tejaswini Medi ; Julia Grabinski ; Margret Keuper
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Through our analysis on the Class False Positive Score, we assess a fair evaluation of how susceptible each class is to misclassification.

159, TITLE: Subjective and Objective Quality Assessment Methods of Stereoscopic Videos with Visibility Affecting Distortions
AUTHORS: Sria Biswas ; Balasubramanyam Appina ; Priyanka Kokil ; Sumohana S Channappayya
CATEGORY: cs.MM [cs.MM, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We present two major contributions in this work: 1) we create a full HD resolution stereoscopic (S3D) video dataset comprised of 12 reference and 360 distorted videos.

160, TITLE: CantorNet: A Sandbox for Testing Topological and Geometrical Measures
AUTHORS: Michal Lewandowski ; Hamid Eghbalzadeh ; Bernhard A. Moser
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: Studying of such symmetries will allow us to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of complex systems. Recognizing the importance of understanding these patterns, we propose a geometrically inspired framework to study such phenomena in artificial neural networks.
