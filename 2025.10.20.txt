HIGHLIGHT: Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong capabilities in code comprehension, but fine-tuning costs and semantic alignment issues limit their project-specific optimization; conversely, fine-tuned models such as CodeBERT are easy to fine-tune, but it is often difficult to learn vulnerability semantics from complex code languages. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Multi-Model Collaborative Vulnerability Detection approach (M2CVD) that leverages the strong capability of analyzing vulnerability semantics from LLMs to improve the detection accuracy of fine-tuned models.

134, TITLE: RankSEG-RMA: An Efficient Segmentation Algorithm Via Reciprocal Moment Approximation
AUTHORS: Zixun Wang; Ben Dai
CATEGORY: arxiv-stat.ML [ML]
HIGHLIGHT: For instance, in LiTS, prediction withRankSEG takes 16.33 seconds compared to just 0.01 seconds with the argmax rule.Second, RankSEG is only applicable to overlapping segmentation settings, wheremultiple classes can occupy the same pixel, which contrasts with standardbenchmarks that typically assume non-overlapping segmentation. In this paper,we overcome these two drawbacks via a reciprocal moment approximation (RMA) ofRankSEG with the following contributions: (i) we improve RankSEG using RMA,namely RankSEG-RMA, reduces the complexity of both algorithms to O(d) whilemaintaining comparable performance; (ii) inspired by RMA, we develop apixel-wise score function that allows efficient implementation fornon-overlapping segmentation settings.

AUTHORS: Tianchen Zhao; Xuanbai Chen; Zhihua Li; Jun Fang; Dongsheng An; Xiang Xu; Zhuowen Tu; Yifan Xing

216, TITLE: Towards Relaxed Multimodal Inputs for Gait-based Parkinson's Disease Assessment
AUTHORS: Minlin Zeng; Zhipeng Zhou; Yang Qiu; Zhiqi Shen
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years,particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques.Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance byeffectively integrating complementary information from various data sources.However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the needto synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on allmodalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the firstParkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as amulti-objective optimization (MOO) problem.

230, TITLE: A Chambolle-Pock Algorithm for Sparse-view CT Reconstruction Via Total Generalized Variation Regularization and Penalized Weighted Least-squares Criterion
AUTHORS: Xueyi Zhang; Pengcheng Zhang; Liyuan Zhang; Yi Liu; Zhiguo Gui
