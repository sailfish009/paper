HIGHLIGHT: A promising approach tomitigate this challenge is to use the security knowledge embedded in largelanguage models (LLMs) to assist security operators during incident handling.Recent research has demonstrated the potential of this approach, but currentmethods are mainly based on prompt engineering of frontier LLMs, which iscostly and prone to hallucinations. We address these limitations by presentinga novel way to use an LLM for incident response planning with reducedhallucination.
