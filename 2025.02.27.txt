AUTHORS: Ujjwal Singh ; Aditi Sharma ; Nikhil Gupta ; Vivek Kumar Jha
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, current benchmarks for evaluating multilingual code generation capabilities are predominantly English-centric, limiting their applicability across the global developer community. To address this limitation, we present IndicEval-XL, a comprehensive benchmark for code generation that incorporates 6 major Indic languages, collectively spoken by approximately 14\% of the world's population.

232, TITLE: Deep Learning and Classical Computer Vision Techniques in Medical Image Analysis: Case Studies on Brain MRI Tissue Segmentation, Lung CT COPD Registration, and Skin Lesion Classification
AUTHORS: Anyimadu Daniel Tweneboah ; Suleiman Taofik Ahmed ; Hossain Mohammad Imran
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This study presents a novel exploration, being the first to systematically evaluate segmentation, registration, and classification tasks across multiple imaging modalities.

233, TITLE: TerraTrace: Temporal Signature Land Use Mapping System
AUTHORS: ANGELA BUSHESKA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We observe that metrics such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), based on plant photosynthesis, have unique temporal signatures that reflect agricultural practices and seasonal cycles.

234, TITLE: Subclass Classification of Gliomas Using MRI Fusion Technique
AUTHORS: Kiranmayee Janardhan ; Christy Bobby Thomas
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: The MRI images from BraTS datasets were used in this work.

235, TITLE: From Traditional to Deep Learning Approaches in Whole Slide Image Registration: A Methodological Review
AUTHORS: BEHNAZ ELHAMINIA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the available approaches and their application for various purposes.
