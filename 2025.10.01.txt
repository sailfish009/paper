HIGHLIGHT: In other words, they can only improve performance onproblems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewardsand thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLMreasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce theproblem difficulty for the model.
