98, TITLE: Context Versus Prior Knowledge in Language Models
AUTHORS: KEVIN DU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We hypothesize that models perform this integration in a predictable way across different questions and contexts: models will rely more on prior knowledge for questions about entities (e.g., persons, places, etc.) that they are more familiar with due to higher exposure in the training corpus, and be more easily persuaded by some contexts than others. To formalize this problem, we propose two mutual information-based metrics to measure a model's dependency on a context and on its prior about an entity: first, the persuasion score of a given context represents how much a model depends on the context in its decision, and second, the susceptibility score of a given entity represents how much the model can be swayed away from its original answer distribution about an entity.

AUTHORS: Haibo Jin ; Haoxuan Che ; Hao Chen
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite its popularity, applying self-training to landmark detection faces three problems: 1) The selected confident pseudo-labels often contain data bias, which may hurt model performance; 2) It is not easy to decide a proper threshold for sample selection as the localization task can be sensitive to noisy pseudo-labels; 3) coordinate regression does not output confidence, making selection-based self-training infeasible. To address the above issues, we propose Self-Training for Landmark Detection (STLD), a method that does not require explicit pseudo-label selection.

AUTHORS: Nagullas KS ; Vivekanand. V ; Narayana Darapaneni ; Anwesh R P
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Introduction: Automated Lung X-Ray Abnormality Detection System is the application which distinguish the normal x-ray images from infected x-ray images and highlight area considered for prediction, with the recent pandemic a need to have a non-conventional method and faster detecting diseases, for which X ray serves the purpose.

398, TITLE: Anatomical Conditioning for Contrastive Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation of Optical Coherence Tomography Images
AUTHORS: Marc S. Seibel ; Hristina Uzunova ; Timo Kepp ; Heinz Handels
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: For a unified analysis of medical images from different modalities, data harmonization using image-to-image (I2I) translation is desired. We study this problem employing an optical coherence tomography (OCT) data set of Spectralis-OCT and Home-OCT images.

399, TITLE: LHU-Net: A Light Hybrid U-Net for Cost-Efficient, High-Performance Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: Yousef Sadegheih ; Afshin Bozorgpour ; Pratibha Kumari ; Reza Azad ; Dorit Merhof
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Moreover, many of these models fail to consider the crucial interplay between spatial and channel features, which could further refine and improve segmentation outcomes. To address this, we introduce LHU-Net, a Light Hybrid U-Net architecture optimized for volumetric medical image segmentation.
