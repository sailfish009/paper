AUTHORS: Berkant Turan ; Suhrab Asadulla ; David Steinmann ; Wolfgang Stammer ; Sebastian Pokutta
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, 68T01, 68T07, I.2.6]
HIGHLIGHT: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path towardverifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet beenapplied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, ConceptBottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretableconcepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unifiedframework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinearclassification in high-dimensional settings.

225, TITLE: A Robust, Open-Source Framework for Spiking Neural Networks on Low-End FPGAs
AUTHORS: Andrew Fan ; Simon D. Levy
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents a framework consisting of a robust SNNacceleration architecture and a Pytorch-based SNN model compiler.

226, TITLE: On Propositional Program Equivalence (extended Abstract)
AUTHORS: Tobias Kapp�
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: In this extended abstract, we discuss recent developments inpropositional program equivalence from the perspective of (Guarded) KleeneAlgebra with Tests, or (G)KAT.

227, TITLE: Input Conditioned Layer Dropping in Speech Foundation Models
AUTHORS: Abdul Hannan ; Daniele Falavigna ; Alessio Brutti
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CV, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: To this end, we propose input-driven$\mathcal{LD}$ that employs the network's input features and a lightweightlayer selecting network to determine the optimum combination of processinglayers.

228, TITLE: Adaptive Attention Residual U-Net for Curvilinear Structure Segmentation in Fluorescence Microscopy and Biomedical Images
AUTHORS: Achraf Ait Laydi ; Louis Cueff ; Mewen Crespo ; Yousef El Mourabit ; H�l�ne Bouvrais
CATEGORY: q-bio.QM [q-bio.QM, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Segmenting curvilinear structures in fluorescence microscopy remains achallenging task, particularly under noisy conditions and in dense filamentnetworks commonly seen in vivo. To address this, we created two originaldatasets consisting of hundreds of synthetic images of fluorescently labelledmicrotubules within cells.

229, TITLE: Label-Efficient Chest X-ray Diagnosis Via Partial CLIP Adaptation
AUTHORS: Heet Nitinkumar Dalsania
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, alabel-efficient strategy is proposed for chest X-ray diagnosis that seeks toreflect real-world hospital scenarios.

230, TITLE: Computationally Efficient Information-Driven Optical Design with Interchanging Optimization
AUTHORS: Eric Markley ; Henry Pinkard ; Leyla Kabuli ; Nalini Singh ; Laura Waller
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CE, cs.CV, cs.IT, math.IT, physics.optics]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we study IDEALacross diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage,long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due toend-to-end differentiability requirements.
