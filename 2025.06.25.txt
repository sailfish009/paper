HIGHLIGHT: These approaches do not explicitlyaccount for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectivelyintegrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specificorgan lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering thestrong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, wepropose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visualfeature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling.Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice ina CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices fromdifferent perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information andalign them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG.Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset showthat our method outperforms strong baseline models and achievesstate-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.

HIGHLIGHT: We propose a newparadigm for parallel programming, the data-autonomous paradigm, wherecomputation is performed by autonomous data elements.

220, TITLE: Look to Locate: Vision-Based Multisensory Navigation with 3-D Digital Maps for GNSS-Challenged Environments
AUTHORS: Ola Elmaghraby ; Eslam Mounier ; Paulo Ricardo Marques de Araujo ; Aboelmagd Noureldin
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper proposes acost-effective, vision-based multi-sensor navigation system that integratesmonocular depth estimation, semantic filtering, and visual map registration(VMR) with 3-D digital maps.

221, TITLE: Robotics Under Construction: Challenges on Job Sites
AUTHORS: HARUKI UCHIITO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.AR, cs.ET, cs.SY, eess.SY]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents an autonomous payloadtransportation system as an initial step toward fully unmanned constructionsites.

222, TITLE: Lost in Translation? Converting RegExes for Log Parsing Into Dynatrace Pattern Language
AUTHORS: Julian Fragner ; Christian Macho ; Bernhard Dieber ; Martin Pinzger
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, D.2.7]
HIGHLIGHT: In thiswork, we present Reptile, which combines a rule-based approach for convertingRegExes into DPL patterns with a best-effort approach for cases where a fullconversion is impossible.

223, TITLE: TTSDS2: Resources and Benchmark for Evaluating Human-Quality Text to Speech Systems
AUTHORS: Christoph Minixhofer ; Ondrej Klejch ; Peter Bell
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we introduce Text to Speech Distribution Score2 (TTSDS2), a more robust and improved version of TTSDS.

224, TITLE: A Standard Transformer and Attention with Linear Biases for Molecular Conformer Generation
AUTHORS: Viatcheslav Gurev ; Timothy Rumbell
CATEGORY: q-bio.BM [q-bio.BM, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the concern has been that non-equivariant modelsrequire a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In thispaper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectivelyaddresses these size limitations.

225, TITLE: Systematic Review of Pituitary Gland and Pituitary Adenoma Automatic Segmentation Techniques in Magnetic Resonance Imaging
AUTHORS: Mubaraq Yakubu ; Navodini Wijethilake ; Jonathan Shapey ; Andrew King ; Alexander Hammers
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Methods: We reviewed 34 studies thatemployed automatic and semi-automatic segmentation methods.
