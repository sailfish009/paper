AUTHORS: NATHANIEL WEIR et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent reasoning methods (e.g., chain-of-thought, entailment reasoning) help users understand how language models (LMs) answer a single question, but they do little to reveal the LM's overall understanding, or "theory," about the question's $\textit{topic}$, making it still hard to trust the model. Our goal is to materialize such theories - here called $\textit{microtheories}$ (a linguistic analog of logical microtheories) - as a set of sentences encapsulating an LM's core knowledge about a topic.

CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR]
HIGHLIGHT: We show that the answer is no with the default approach of injecting i.i.d.~random noise to the gradients because the estimation uncertainty of the data value estimation paradoxically linearly scales with more estimation budget, producing estimates almost like random guesses. To address this issue, we propose to instead inject carefully correlated noise to provably remove the linear scaling of estimation uncertainty w.r.t.~the budget.
