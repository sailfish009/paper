CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: While there have been significant advances in the last years in variety classification (Jauhiainen et al., 2019) and state-of-the-art approaches reach accuracies of up to 100% depending on the similarity of varieties and the scope of prediction (e.g., Milne et al., 2012; Blodgett et al., 2017), forensic linguistics rarely relies on these approaches due to their lack of transparency (see Nini, 2023), amongst other reasons. In this paper we therefore explore explainability of machine learning approaches considering the forensic context.
