2, TITLE: Spontaneous Reward Hacking in Iterative Self-Refinement
AUTHORS: Jane Pan ; He He ; Samuel R. Bowman ; Shi Feng
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, because the evaluator is an imperfect proxy of user preference, this optimization can lead to reward hacking, where the evaluator's ratings improve while the generation quality remains stagnant or even decreases as judged by actual user preference. The concern of reward hacking is heightened in iterative self-refinement where the generator and the evaluator use the same underlying language model, in which case the optimization pressure can drive them to exploit shared vulnerabilities.

AUTHORS: AHMED MASRY et. al.

We address these important drawbacks and introduce ChartGemma, a novel chart understanding and reasoning model developed over PaliGemma.

AUTHORS: Aaron Mueller
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Specifically, (i) counterfactual theories do not effectively capture multiple independently sufficient causes of the same effect, which leads us to miss certain causes entirely; and (ii) counterfactual dependencies in neural networks are generally not transitive, which complicates methods for extracting and interpreting causal graphs from neural networks. We discuss the implications of these challenges for interpretability researchers and propose concrete suggestions for future work.

AUTHORS: Alex Ergasti ; Tomaso Fontanini ; Claudio Ferrari ; Massimo Bertozzi ; Andrea Prati
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: One is defined as inter-identity noise that is due to the inherent vagueness and imprecision of text descriptions and it indicates how descriptions of visual attributes can be generally associated to different people; the other is the intra-identity variations, which are all those nuisances e.g. pose, illumination, that can alter the visual appearance of the same textual attributes for a given subject. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel TBPS architecture named MARS (Mae-Attribute-Relation-Sensitive), which enhances current state-of-the-art models by introducing two key components: a Visual Reconstruction Loss and an Attribute Loss.

HIGHLIGHT: Through prompting experiments and by probing internal activations, we show that current large language models (LLMs) can distinguish past from future events, with probes on model activations achieving $90\%$ accuracy. We train models with backdoors triggered by a temporal distributional shift; they activate when the model is exposed to news headlines beyond their training cut-off dates.

159, TITLE: SineKAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks Using Sinusoidal Activation Functions
AUTHORS: Eric A. F. Reinhardt ; Sergei Gleyzer
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we present a model in which learnable grids of B-Spline activation functions can be replaced by grids of re-weighted sine functions.

160, TITLE: Mixture of A Million Experts
AUTHORS: Xu Owen He
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces PEER (parameter efficient expert retrieval), a novel layer design that utilizes the product key technique for sparse retrieval from a vast pool of tiny experts (over a million).

161, TITLE: Predictive Coding Networks and Inference Learning: Tutorial and Survey
AUTHORS: Bj�rn van Zwol ; Ro Jefferson ; Egon L. van den Broek
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cond-mat.dis-nn, cs.AI, cs.NE, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: Moreover, PCNs can be mathematically considered as a superset of traditional FNNs, which substantially extends the range of possible architectures for both supervised and unsupervised learning. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review as well as a formal specification of PCNs, in particular placing them in the context of modern ML methods, and positioning PC as a versatile and promising framework worthy of further study by the ML community.

162, TITLE: Rethinking Image Compression on The Web with Generative AI
AUTHORS: Shayan Ali Hassan ; Danish Humair ; Ihsan Ayyub Qazi ; Zafar Ayyub Qazi
CATEGORY: cs.NI [cs.NI, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.IV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper explores a novel approach using generative AI to reconstruct images at the edge or client-side.

163, TITLE: VoxAct-B: Voxel-Based Acting and Stabilizing Policy for Bimanual Manipulation
AUTHORS: I-Chun Arthur Liu ; Sicheng He ; Daniel Seita ; Gaurav Sukhatme
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To this end, we propose VoxAct-B, a language-conditioned, voxel-based method that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to prioritize key regions within the scene and reconstruct a voxel grid.

164, TITLE: Resource-Efficient Speech Quality Prediction Through Quantization Aware Training and Binary Activation Maps
AUTHORS: Mattias Nilsson ; Riccardo Miccini ; Cl�ment Laroche ; Tobias Piechowiak ; Friedemann Zenke
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.NE, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: Deep learning methods provide high-quality estimates of objective and subjective speech quality metrics.

165, TITLE: Computing Clipped Products
AUTHORS: Arthur C. Norman ; Stephen M. Watt
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC, cs.NA, math.NA]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper we provide algorithms for the general problem of computing a given span of coefficients within a product, that is the terms within a range of degrees for univariate polynomials or range digits of an integer.

166, TITLE: Lost in Translation: The Algorithmic Gap Between LMs and The Brain
AUTHORS: Tommaso Tosato ; Pascal Jr Tikeng Notsawo ; Saskia Helbling ; Irina Rish ; Guillaume Dumas
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: By developing LMs that more closely mimic brain function, we aim to advance both artificial intelligence and our understanding of human cognition.

167, TITLE: Embracing Massive Medical Data
AUTHORS: Yu-Cheng Chou ; Zongwei Zhou ; Alan Yuille
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Second, training AI continuously on new scans/sources/classes can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where AI forgets old data as it learns new data, and vice versa. To address these two challenges, we propose an online learning method that enables training AI from massive medical data.

168, TITLE: Few-Shot Airway-Tree Modeling Using Data-Driven Sparse Priors
AUTHORS: Ali Keshavarzi ; Elsa Angelini
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, 92C55, I.4.6]
HIGHLIGHT: Few-shot learning approaches are cost-effective solutions to transfer pre-trained models using only limited annotated data.
