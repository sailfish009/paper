16, TITLE: Think-Then-Generate: Reasoning-Aware Text-to-Image Diffusion with LLM Encoders
AUTHORS: SIQI KOU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning.

AUTHORS: Seoyeon Kim ; Jaehyung Kim
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.CL]

To address this, we introduce SPRInG, a novel semi-parametric framework designed for effective continual personalization.  [Save to Library]

80, TITLE: EHRNavigator: A Multi-Agent System for Patient-Level Clinical Question Answering Over Heterogeneous Electronic Health Records
AUTHORS: LINGFEI QIAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Clinical decision-making increasingly relies on timely and context-aware access to patient information within Electronic Health Records (EHRs), yet most existing natural language question-answering (QA) systems are evaluated solely on benchmark datasets, limiting their practical relevance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce EHRNavigator, a multi-agent framework that harnesses AI agents to perform patient-level question answering across heterogeneous and multimodal EHR data.

AUTHORS: CHENGBING WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been utilized to enhance empathy of LLMs, existing reward models typically evaluate empathy from a single perspective, overlooking the inherently bidirectional interaction nature of empathy between the supporter and seeker as defined by Empathy Cycle theory. To address this limitation, we propose Psychology-grounded Empathetic Reward Modeling (PERM).  [Save to Library]

89, TITLE: Skill-Aware Data Selection and Fine-Tuning for Data-Efficient Reasoning Distillation
AUTHORS: Lechen Zhang ; Yunxiang Zhang ; Wei Hu ; Lu Wang
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Yet, distilling these models often demands large-scale data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), motivating the pursuit of data-efficient training methods. To address this, we propose a skill-centric distillation framework that efficiently transfers reasoning ability to weaker models with two components: (1) Skill-based data selection, which prioritizes examples targeting the student model's weaker skills, and (2) Skill-aware fine-tuning, which encourages explicit skill decomposition during problem solving.

AUTHORS: Jiujiu Chen ; Weijun Zeng ; Shaofeng Hu ; Sihong Xie ; Hui Xiong
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: GFMs have been successfully applied to detection of individual anomalies but cannot be generalized to group anomalies, as group anomaly patterns must be detected as a whole and individuals in an abnormal group can look rather normal. Therefore, we propose GFM4GA, a novel graph foundation model for group anomaly detection.  [Save to Library]
