67, TITLE: ArrowGEV: Grounding Events in Video Via Learning The Arrow of Time
AUTHORS: Fangxu Yu ; Ziyao Lu ; Liqiang Niu ; Fandong Meng ; Jie Zhou
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paradigm hinders VLMs from capturing the inherent temporal structure and directionality of events, thereby limiting robustness and generalization. To address this limitation, inspired by the arrow of time in physics, which characterizes the intrinsic directionality of temporal processes, we propose ArrowGEV, a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly models temporal directionality in events to improve both event grounding and temporal directionality understanding in VLMs.  [Save to Library]

71, TITLE: Unified Personalized Understanding, Generating and Editing
AUTHORS: YU ZHONG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing personalization methods typically rely on external retrieval, which is inefficient and poorly integrated into unified multimodal pipelines. Recent personalized unified models introduce learnable soft prompts to encode concept information, yet they either couple understanding and generation or depend on complex multi-stage training, leading to cross-task interference and ultimately to fuzzy or misaligned personalized knowledge.

76, TITLE: Watching, Reasoning, and Searching: A Video Deep Research Benchmark on Open Web for Agentic Video Reasoning
AUTHORS: CHENGWEN LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: VideoDR centers on video-conditioned open-domain video question answering, requiring cross-frame visual anchor extraction, interactive web retrieval, and multi-hop reasoning over joint video-web evidence; through rigorous human annotation and quality control, we obtain high-quality video deep research samples spanning six semantic domains. We evaluate multiple closed-source and open-source multimodal large language models under both the Workflow and Agentic paradigms, and the results show that Agentic is not consistently superior to Workflow: its gains depend on a model's ability to maintain the initial video anchors over long retrieval chains.

AUTHORS: HUA YE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Large language models (LLMs) equipped with retrieval--the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm--should combine their parametric knowledge with external evidence, yet in practice they often hallucinate, over-trust noisy snippets, or ignore vital context. We introduce TCR (Transparent Conflict Resolution), a plug-and-play framework that makes this decision process observable and controllable.  [Save to Library]

AUTHORS: Zohaib Khan ; Omer Tafveez ; Zoha Hayat Bhatti
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]

We investigate this by training models on a single A40 GPU (48GB) for under 24 hours using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).  [Save to Library]

HIGHLIGHT: We identify a critical failure mode of such reference-based LLM QA evaluation: when the provided reference conflicts with the judge model's parametric knowledge, the resulting scores become unreliable, substantially degrading evaluation fidelity. To study this phenomenon systematically, we introduce a controlled swapped-reference QA framework that induces reference-belief conflicts.  [Save to Library]
