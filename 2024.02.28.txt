HIGHLIGHT: However, very few models effectively integrate clinical information with imaging data. To address this shortcoming, we suggest a multimodal fusion methodology, termed PE-MVCNet, which capitalizes on Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography imaging and EMR data.

239, TITLE: How We Won BraTS 2023 Adult Glioma Challenge? Just Faking It! Enhanced Synthetic Data Augmentation and Model Ensemble for Brain Tumour Segmentation
AUTHORS: ANDR� FERREIRA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, this requires a lot of high-quality data, which is difficult to obtain, especially in the medical field. Therefore, our solutions address this problem by using unconventional mechanisms for data augmentation.

240, TITLE: V2C-Long: Longitudinal Cortex Reconstruction with Spatiotemporal Correspondence
AUTHORS: Fabian Bongratz ; Jan Fecht ; Anne-Marie Rickmann ; Christian Wachinger
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Especially the lack of strong spatiotemporal point correspondence hinders downstream analyses due to the introduced noise. To address this issue, we present V2C-Long, the first dedicated deep learning-based cortex reconstruction method for longitudinal MRI.
