169, TITLE: GALAX: Graph-Augmented Language Model for Explainable Reinforcement-Guided Subgraph Reasoning in Precision Medicine
AUTHORS: HEMING ZHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing pipelines captureonly part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centricLLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse nodesemantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, theyremain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability toreward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integratingquantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principlebridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model witheXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained GraphNeural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcementguided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevantsubgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluatedby a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicitintermediate reasoning annotations.

250, TITLE: Sycophancy Is Not One Thing: Causal Separation of Sycophantic Behaviors in LLMs
AUTHORS: Daniel Vennemeyer ; Phan Anh Duong ; Tiffany Zhan ; Tianyu Jiang
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such asexcessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whetherthese behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models anddatasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinctlinear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independentlyamplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) theirrepresentational structure is consistent across model families and scales.These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,independently steerable representations.
