AUTHORS: Yuxiang Zhou ; Hainiu Xu ; Desmond C. Ong ; Petr Slovak ; Yulan He
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]

156, TITLE: Taming Knowledge Conflicts in Language Models
AUTHORS: Gaotang Li ; Yuzhong Chen ; Hanghang Tong

In this study, we go beyond this fundamental assumption by uncovering a critical phenomenon we term the "superposition of contextual information and parametric memory", where highly influential attention heads could simultaneously contribute to both memory and context.

239, TITLE: Don't Forget It! Conditional Sparse Autoencoder Clamping Works for Unlearning
AUTHORS: Matthew Khoriaty ; Andrii Shportko ; Gustavo Mercier ; Zach Wood-Doughty
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: The use of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) has recently emerged as a potential method of unraveling representations of concepts in LLMs internals, and has allowed developers to steer model outputs by directly modifying the hidden activations. In this paper, we use SAEs to identify unwanted concepts from the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) dataset within gemma-2-2b internals and use feature steering to reduce the model's ability to answer harmful questions while retaining its performance on harmless queries.
