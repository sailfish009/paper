To overcome these limitations, we introduce Direct Q-function Optimization (DQO), which formulates the response generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilizes the soft actor-critic (SAC) framework to optimize a Q-function directly parameterized by the language model.

546, TITLE: One Step at A Time: Combining LLMs and Static Analysis to Generate Next-Step Hints for Programming Tasks
AUTHORS: ANASTASIIA BIRILLO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.CY, cs.HC]
HIGHLIGHT: While LLMs constitute a promising technology for providing personalized help, combining them with other techniques, such as static analysis, can significantly improve the output quality. In this work, we utilize this idea and propose a novel system to provide both textual and code hints for programming tasks.

549, TITLE: On Goodhart's Law, with An Application to Value Alignment
AUTHORS: El-Mahdi El-Mhamdi ; L�-Nguy�n Hoang
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, math.ST, stat.TH]
HIGHLIGHT: ``When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure'', this adage is known as {\it Goodhart's law}. In this paper, we investigate formally this law and prove that it critically depends on the tail distribution of the discrepancy between the true goal and the measure that is optimized.

AUTHORS: Ryotaro Nagase ; Takashi Sumiyoshi ; Natsuo Yamashita ; Kota Dohi ; Yohei Kawaguchi
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper proposes a zero-shot speech emotion recognition (SER) method that estimates emotions not previously defined in the SER model training.

552, TITLE: MOZART: Ensembling Approach for COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-Ray Imagery
AUTHORS: Mohammed Shabo ; Nazar Siddig

HIGHLIGHT: Thus We introduce the MOZART framework, an ensemble learning approach that enhances the virus detection.

553, TITLE: Preserving Cardiac Integrity: A Topology-Infused Approach to Whole Heart Segmentation
AUTHORS: Chenyu Zhang ; Wenxue Guan ; Xiaodan Xing ; Guan Yang
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, segmentation of whole-heart structures faces numerous challenges including heart shape variability during the cardiac cycle, clinical artifacts like motion and poor contrast-to-noise ratio, domain shifts in multi-center data, and the distinct modalities of CT and MRI. To address these limitations and improve segmentation quality, this paper introduces a new topology-preserving module that is integrated into deep neural networks.

554, TITLE: Two-Stage Approach for Brain MR Image Synthesis: 2D Image Synthesis and 3D Refinement
AUTHORS: Jihoon Cho ; Seunghyuck Park ; Jinah Park
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach that first synthesizes MR images from 2D slices using a novel intensity encoding method and then refines the synthesized MRI.

555, TITLE: A Novel No-Reference Image Quality Metric For Assessing Sharpness In Satellite Imagery
AUTHORS: Lucas Gonzalo Antonel
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This study introduces a novel no-reference image quality metric aimed at assessing image sharpness.
