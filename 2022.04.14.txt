3, TITLE: An Ensemble Learning Based Approach to Multi-label Power Text Classification for Fault-type Recognition
AUTHORS: Chen Xiaona ; Ahmad Tanvir ; Ma Yinglong
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, 68T07, I.2.1; I.2.6]
HIGHLIGHT: With the rapid development of ICT Custom Services (ICT CS) in power industries, the deployed power ICT CS systems mainly rely on the experience of customer service staff for fault type recognition, questioning, and answering, which makes it difficult and inefficient to precisely resolve the problems issued by users. To resolve this problem, in this paper, firstly, a multi-label fault text classification ensemble approach called BR-GBDT is proposed by combining Binary Relevance and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree for assisted fault type diagnosis and improving the accuracy of fault type recognition.

5, TITLE: Fair Algorithm Design: Fair and Efficacious Machine Scheduling

In this paper, we prove that this dichotomy between fairness and efficacy can be overcome if we allow for a negligible amount of bias: there exist algorithms that are both "almost perfectly fair" and have a constant factor efficacy ratio, that is, are guaranteed to output solutions that have social welfare within a constant factor of optimal welfare.

83, TITLE: Chaining of Numerical Black-box Algorithms: Warm-Starting and Switching Points
AUTHORS: Dominik Schröder ; Diederick Vermetten ; Hao Wang ; Carola Doerr ; Thomas Bäck
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Dynamic algorithm selection can be beneficial for solving numerical black-box problems, in which we implement an online switching mechanism between optimization algorithms.

84, TITLE: Population Diversity Leads to Short Running Times of Lexicase Selection
AUTHORS: Thomas Helmuth ; Johannes Lengler ; William La Cava
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper we investigate why the running time of lexicase parent selection is empirically much lower than its worst-case bound of O(N*C).

85, TITLE: Sapinet: A Sparse Event-based Spatiotemporal Oscillator for Learning in The Wild
AUTHORS: Ayon Borthakur
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a systematic method to tune the network for performance.

86, TITLE: Trajectory-based Algorithm Selection with Warm-starting
AUTHORS: ANJA JANKOVIC et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we apply the trajectory-based approach onto a portfolio of five algorithms.

87, TITLE: Modular and Didactic Compiler Design with XML Inter-Phases Communication
AUTHORS: Eduardo Adam Navas-López
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, D.3.4; E.2]
HIGHLIGHT: This article presents the design, educative characteristics and possibilities of a modular and didactic compiler for a Pascal-like programming mini-language that is super-set of Niklaus Wirth's PL/0.

88, TITLE: Evolving Modular Soft Robots Without Explicit Inter-Module Communication Using Local Self-Attention
AUTHORS: Federico Pigozzi ; Yujin Tang ; Eric Medvet ; David Ha
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: We use the same neural controller inside each voxel, but without any inter-voxel communication, hence enabling ideal conditions for modularity: modules are all equal and interchangeable.

89, TITLE: ViViD++: Vision for Visibility Dataset
AUTHORS: Alex Junho Lee ; Younggun Cho ; Young-sik Shin ; Ayoung Kim ; Hyun Myung
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present a dataset capturing diverse visual data formats that target varying luminance conditions.

90, TITLE: What Matters in Language Conditioned Robotic Imitation Learning
AUTHORS: Oier Mees ; Lukas Hermann ; Wolfram Burgard
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we conduct an extensive study of the most critical challenges in learning language conditioned policies from offline free-form imitation datasets.

91, TITLE: Large-scale Multi-objective Influence Maximisation with Network Downscaling
AUTHORS: Elia Cunegatti ; Giovanni Iacca ; Doina Bucur
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose an original method, based on network downscaling, that allows a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to solve the IM problem on a reduced scale network, while preserving the relevant properties of the original network.

92, TITLE: Encoding Domain Knowledge in Multi-view Latent Variable Models: A Bayesian Approach with Structured Sparsity
AUTHORS: Arber Qoku ; Florian Buettner
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose MuVI, a novel approach for domain-informed multi-view latent variable models, facilitating the analysis of multi-view data in an inherently explainable manner.

93, TITLE: WSSS4LUAD: Grand Challenge on Weakly-supervised Tissue Semantic Segmentation for Lung Adenocarcinoma
AUTHORS: CHU HAN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Participants have to design the algorithm to segment tumor epithelial, tumor-associated stroma and normal tissue with only patch-level labels.

94, TITLE: Deep Learning-based Framework for Automatic Cranial Defect Reconstruction and Implant Modeling
AUTHORS: MAREK WODZINSKI et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: The goal of this work is to propose a robust, fast, and fully automatic method for personalized cranial defect reconstruction and implant modeling.

95, TITLE: SRMD: Sparse Random Mode Decomposition
AUTHORS: Nicholas Richardson ; Hayden Schaeffer ; Giang Tran
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.CV, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: We proposed a random feature method for analyzing time-series data by constructing a sparse approximation to the spectrogram.
