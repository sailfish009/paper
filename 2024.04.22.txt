85, TITLE: A Clean-graph Backdoor Attack Against Graph Convolutional Networks with Poisoned Label Only
AUTHORS: Jiazhu Dai ; Haoyu Sun

In order to explore the backdoor vulnerability of GCNs and create a more practical and stealthy backdoor attack method, this paper proposes a clean-graph backdoor attack against GCNs (CBAG) in the node classification task,which only poisons the training labels without any modification to the training samples, revealing that GCNs have this security vulnerability.

161, TITLE: Global Counterfactual Directions
AUTHORS: Bartlomiej Sobieski ; Przemys?aw Biecek
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Specifically, we discover that the latent space of Diffusion Autoencoders encodes the inference process of a given classifier in the form of global directions. We propose a novel proxy-based approach that discovers two types of these directions with the use of only single image in an entirely black-box manner.

AUTHORS: Tom T. P. Franken ; Thomas Neele
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: Considering the paradigm and the design choices of AuDaLa, it is interesting to determine the expressiveness of the language and to create verification methods for it. In this paper, we take our first steps to such a verification method by implementing Turing machines in AuDaLa and proving that implementation correct.

169, TITLE: Random Network Distillation Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for AGV Path Planning
AUTHORS: HUILIN YIN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]

170, TITLE: Show and Grasp: Few-shot Semantic Segmentation for Robot Grasping Through Zero-shot Foundation Models
AUTHORS: Leonardo Barcellona ; Alberto Bacchin ; Matteo Terreran ; Emanuele Menegatti ; Stefano Ghidoni
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, this often comes at the cost of limited performance and fine-tuning is required to be effective in robot grasping scenarios. In this work, we propose to overcome all these limitations by combining the impressive generalization capability reached by foundation models with a high-performing few-shot classifier, working as a score function to select the segmentation that is closer to the support set.
