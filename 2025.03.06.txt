We explore distilled representations from LLM activations and find that function vectors (FVs; Todd et al., 2024) - compact representations for in-context learning (ICL) tasks - are not invariant to simple input changes (e.g., open-ended vs. multiple-choice), suggesting they capture more than pure concepts.

107, TITLE: SEOE: A Scalable and Reliable Semantic Evaluation Framework for Open Domain Event Detection
AUTHORS: YI-FAN LU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]

To address these two problems above, we propose a scalable and reliable Semantic-level Evaluation framework for Open domain Event detection (SEOE) by constructing a more representative evaluation benchmark and introducing a semantic evaluation metric.
