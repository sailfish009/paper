3, TITLE: On The Interplay of Pre-Training, Mid-Training, and RL on Reasoning Language Models
AUTHORS: Charlie Zhang; Graham Neubig; Xiang Yue
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: A central challenge is the lack of control in modern training pipelines: large-scale pre-training corpora are opaque, mid-training is often underexamined, and RL objectives interact with unknown prior knowledge in complex ways. To resolve this ambiguity, we develop a fully controlled experimental framework that isolates the causal contributions of pre-training, mid-training, and RL-based post-training.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.RO [RO]
HIGHLIGHT: However, their potential is often constrained by inaccurate high-level guidance and the computational overhead of complex guidance modules. To address these limitations, we propose Mimir, a novel hierarchical dual-system framework capable of generating robust trajectories relying on goal points with uncertainty estimation: (1) Unlike previous approaches that deterministically model, we estimate goal point uncertainty with a Laplace distribution to enhance robustness; (2) To overcome the slow inference speed of the guidance system, we introduce a multi-rate guidance mechanism that predicts extended goal points in advance.

8, TITLE: Towards Robust DeepFake Detection Under Unstable Face Sequences: Adaptive Sparse Graph Embedding with Order-Free Representation and Explicit Laplacian Spectral Prior
AUTHORS: Chih-Chung Hsu; Shao-Ning Chen; Chia-Ming Lee; Yi-Fang Wang; Yi-Shiuan Chou
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Most existing detectors implicitly assume temporally consistent and clean facial sequences, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world scenarios where compression artifacts, occlusions, and adversarial attacks destabilize face detection and often lead to invalid or misdetected faces. To address these challenges, we propose a Laplacian-Regularized Graph Convolutional Network (LR-GCN) that robustly detects DeepFakes from noisy or unordered face sequences, while being trained only on clean facial data.

9, TITLE: Rethinking Training Dynamics in Scale-wise Autoregressive Generation
AUTHORS: Gengze Zhou; Chongjian Ge; Hao Tan; Feng Liu; Yicong Hong

Through a comprehensive analysis of training dynamics, we propose Self-Autoregressive Refinement (SAR) to address these limitations.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The substantial disparity between Pass@K (with large K) and Pass@1 across numerous models provides compelling evidence that such failures primarily stem from misreasoning rather than ignorance.

In this work, we analyze the per-sample gradient of BT-loss and show that its norm scales with two distinct components: (1) the difference in predicted rewards between chosen and rejected responses, which reflects the prediction error, and critically, (2) representation distance between the pair measured in the output space of the final layer.

To resolve this conflict, we propose VideoCoF, a novel Chain-of-Frames approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

70, TITLE: Flash Multi-Head Feed-Forward Network
AUTHORS: Minshen Zhang; Xiang Hu; Jianguo Li; Wei Wu; Kewei Tu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While multi-head mechanisms enhance expressivity in attention, naively applying them to FFNs faces two challenges: memory consumption scaling with the head count, and an imbalanced ratio between the growing intermediate size and the fixed head dimension as models scale, which degrades scalability and expressive power. To address these challenges, we propose Flash Multi-Head FFN (FlashMHF), with two key innovations: an I/O-aware fused kernel computing outputs online in SRAM akin to FlashAttention, and a design using dynamically weighted parallel sub-networks to maintain a balanced ratio between intermediate and head dimensions.

71, TITLE: IFFair: Influence Function-driven Sample Reweighting for Fair Classification
AUTHORS: Jingran Yang; Min Zhang; Lingfeng Zhang; Zhaohui Wang; Yonggang Zhang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing benchmarks for evaluating whether LLMs genuinely possess this capability suffer from three key limitations: a lack of contextual scenarios, insufficient cross-cultural concept mapping, and limited deep cultural reasoning capabilities.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although diffusion models with strong visual priors have emerged as powerful dense prediction backboens, they overlook a core limitation: the stochastic noise at the core of diffusion sampling is inherently misaligned with dense prediction that requires a deterministic mapping from image to geometry. In this paper, we show that this stochastic noise corrupts fine-grained spatial cues and pushes the model toward timestep-specific noise objectives, consequently destroying meaningful geometric structure mappings.

To address these challenges, we introduce Style Invariance as a Correctness Likelihood (SICL), a framework that leverages style-invariance for robust uncertainty estimation.

212, TITLE: Integrating Multi-scale and Multi-filtration Topological Features for Medical Image Classification
AUTHORS: Pengfei Gu; Huimin Li; Haoteng Tang; Erik Enriquez; DongChul Kim; Bin Fu; Danny Z. Chen
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, such networks either emphasize pixel-intensity features instead of fundamental anatomical structures (e.g., those encoded by topological invariants), or they capture only simple topological features via single-parameter persistence. In this paper, we propose a new topology-guided classification framework that extracts multi-scale and multi-filtration persistent topological features and integrates them into vision classification backbones.

213, TITLE: Look Twice Before You Leap: A Rational Agent Framework for Localized Adversarial Anonymization
AUTHORS: Donghang Duan; Xu Zheng

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing methods lack 3D human structural understanding, producing geometrically inconsistent results with distorted limb proportions and unnatural human-object fusion, while memory-constrained downsampling causes human boundary drift toward background geometry. To address these limitations, we propose to incorporate hybrid geometric priors that combine SMPL human body models with monocular depth estimation.

216, TITLE: A-3PO: Accelerating Asynchronous LLM Training with Staleness-aware Proximal Policy Approximation

219, TITLE: Ensembling LLM-Induced Decision Trees for Explainable and Robust Error Detection
AUTHORS: Mengqi Wang; Jianwei Wang; Qing Liu; Xiwei Xu; Zhenchang Xing; Liming Zhu; Wenjie Zhang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, this LLM-as-a-labeler pipeline (1) relies on the black box, implicit decision process, thus failing to provide explainability for the detection results, and (2) is highly sensitive to prompts, yielding inconsistent outputs due to inherent model stochasticity, therefore lacking robustness. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM-as-an-inducer framework that adopts LLM to induce the decision tree for ED (termed TreeED) and further ensembles multiple such trees for consensus detection (termed ForestED), thereby improving explainability and robustness.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In controllable image generation, synthesizing coherent and consistent images from multiple reference inputs, i.e., Multi-Image Composition (MICo), remains a challenging problem, partly hindered by the lack of high-quality training data. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic study of MICo, categorizing it into 7 representative tasks and curate a large-scale collection of high-quality source images and construct diverse MICo prompts.

AUTHORS: Zeqi Chen; Zhaoyang Chu; Yi Gui; Feng Guo; Yao Wan; Chuan Shi
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: While prior studies have explored graphaugmented prompting and structure-aware pretraining, they either suffer from prompt length constraints or require task-specific architectural changes that are incompatible with large-scale instructionfollowing LLMs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes CGBridge, a novel plug-and-play method that enhances LLMs with Code Graph information through an external, trainable Bridge module.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While supervised fine-tuning on MedVidBench yields noticeable gains, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) fails due to imbalanced reward scales across datasets, which destabilizes optimization and leads to training collapse. To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{MedGRPO}, a novel RL framework for balanced multi-dataset training with two key innovations: (1) \emph{cross-dataset reward normalization} that maps each dataset's median performance to a common reward value, ensuring fair optimization regardless of difficulty, and (2) a \emph{medical LLM judge} that evaluates caption quality on five clinical dimensions through comparative similarity scoring.

255, TITLE: Securing The Model Context Protocol: Defending LLMs Against Tool Poisoning and Adversarial Attacks
AUTHORS: Saeid Jamshidi; Kawser Wazed Nafi; Arghavan Moradi Dakhel; Negar Shahabi; Foutse Khomh; Naser Ezzati-Jivan
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CR [CR]
HIGHLIGHT: This work analyzes three classes of semantic attacks on MCP-integrated systems: (1) Tool Poisoning, where adversarial instructions are hidden in tool descriptors; (2) Shadowing, where trusted tools are indirectly compromised through contaminated shared context; and (3) Rug Pulls, where descriptors are altered after approval to subvert behavior. To counter these threats, we introduce a layered security framework with three components: RSA-based manifest signing to enforce descriptor integrity, LLM-on-LLM semantic vetting to detect suspicious tool definitions, and lightweight heuristic guardrails that block anomalous tool behavior at runtime.

257, TITLE: Entropic Confinement and Mode Connectivity in Overparameterized Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Luca Di Carlo; Chase Goddard; David J. Schwab
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Modern neural networks exhibit a striking property: basins of attraction in the loss landscape are often connected by low-loss paths, yet optimization dynamics generally remain confined to a single convex basin and rarely explore intermediate points. We resolve this paradox by identifying entropic barriers arising from the interplay between curvature variations along these paths and noise in optimization dynamics.

HIGHLIGHT: However, this mismatch breaks long-range geometric dependencies, producing holes and fragmented components. To address this critical limitation, we introduce MeshRipple, which expands a mesh outward from an active generation frontier, akin to a ripple on a surface.MeshRipple rests on three key innovations: a frontier-aware BFS tokenization that aligns the generation order with surface topology; an expansive prediction strategy that maintains coherent, connected surface growth; and a sparse-attention global memory that provides an effectively unbounded receptive field to resolve long-range topological dependencies.This integrated design enables MeshRipple to generate meshes with high surface fidelity and topological completeness, outperforming strong recent baselines.

AUTHORS: Tingyu Li; Zheng Sun; Jingxuan Wei; Siyuan Li; Conghui He; Lijun Wu; Cheng Tan
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose DoGe (Decouple to Generalize), a dual-decoupling framework that guides models to first learn from context rather than problem solving by refocusing on the problem context scenarios overlooked by synthetic data methods. By decoupling learning process into dual components (Thinker and Solver), we reasonably quantify the reward signals of this process and propose a two-stage RL post-training approach from freely exploring context to practically solving tasks.

266, TITLE: Enhancing Agentic RL with Progressive Reward Shaping and Value-based Sampling Policy Optimization
AUTHORS: Zhuoran Zhuang; Ye Chen; Jianghao Su; Chao Luo; Luhui Liu; Xia Zeng
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) optimizes such models over full tool-interaction trajectories, but two key challenges hinder effectiveness: (1) Sparse, non-instructive rewards, such as binary 0-1 verifiable signals, provide limited guidance for intermediate steps and slow convergence; (2) Gradient degradation in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), where identical rewards within a rollout group yield zero advantage, reducing sample efficiency and destabilizing training. To address these challenges, we propose two complementary techniques: Progressive Reward Shaping (PRS) and Value-based Sampling Policy Optimization (VSPO).

AUTHORS: Zhongchun Zhou; Chengtao Lai; Yuhang Gu; Wei Zhang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AR [AR]
HIGHLIGHT: Instead of further complicating software development with deeply hierarchical scratchpad memories (SPMs) and their asynchronous management, we investigate the opposite point of the design spectrum: a multi-core AI accelerator equipped with a shared system-level cache and application-aware management policies, which keeps the programming effort modest.

290, TITLE: Transferring Clinical Knowledge Into ECGs Representation
AUTHORS: Jose Geraldo Fernandes; Luiz Facury de Souza; Pedro Robles Dutenhefner; Gisele L. Pappa; Wagner Meira
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]

AUTHORS: Shilong Jin; Haoran Duan; Litao Hua; Wentao Huang; Yuan Zhou
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Moreover, we find different UNet layers show different effects of prior view in CA. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, TD-Attn, which addresses multi-view inconsistency via two key components: (1) the 3D-Aware Attention Guidance Module (3D-AAG) constructs a view-consistent 3D attention Gaussian for subject-words to enforce spatial consistency across attention-focused regions, thereby compensating for the limited spatial information in 2D individual view CA maps; (2) the Hierarchical Attention Modulation Module (HAM) utilizes a Semantic Guidance Tree (SGT) to direct the Semantic Response Profiler (SRP) in localizing and modulating CA layers that are highly responsive to view conditions, where the enhanced CA maps further support the construction of more consistent 3D attention Gaussians.

HIGHLIGHT: Traditional level set methods, while effective in certain cases, often depend on approximate bias field estimations and therefore struggle under severe non-uniform imaging conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel variational Reflectance-based Level Set Model (RefLSM), which explicitly integrates Retinex-inspired reflectance decomposition into the segmentation framework.

313, TITLE: Structure-Aware Feature Rectification with Region Adjacency Graphs for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation

We address this by training without any real abnormal videos while evaluating under the standard weakly supervised split, and we introduce PA-VAD, a generation-driven approach that learns a detector from synthesized pseudo-abnormal videos paired with real normal videos, using only a small set of real normal images to drive synthesis.

To rectify this, we propose RicciKGE to have the KGE loss gradient coupled with local curvatures in an extended Ricci flow such that entity embeddings co-evolve dynamically with the underlying manifold geometry towards mutual adaptation.

AUTHORS: Latifa Dwiyanti; Sergio Ryan Wibisono; Hidetaka Nambo
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While SHAP effectively visualizes feature importance, it often lacks contextual explanations that are meaningful for end-users, especially those without technical backgrounds. To address this gap, we propose a Python package that extends SHAP by integrating it with a large language model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT, to generate contextualized textual explanations.

384, TITLE: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Under Confounding
AUTHORS: Nishanth Venkatesh; Andreas A. Malikopoulos
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In such settings, conventional model-learning methods are fundamentally inconsistent, as the transition and reward mechanisms generated under a behavioral policy do not correspond to the interventional quantities required for evaluating a state-based policy. To address this issue, we adapt a proximal off-policy evaluation approach that identifies the confounded reward expectation using only observable state-action-reward trajectories under mild invertibility conditions on proxy variables.

386, TITLE: Towards Robust Protective Perturbation Against DeepFake Face Swapping
AUTHORS: Hengyang Yao; Lin Li; Ke Sun; Jianing Qiu; Huiping Chen
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 30 transformations across six categories and show that protection robustness is highly sensitive to the choice of training transformations, making the standard Expectation over Transformation (EOT) with uniform sampling fundamentally suboptimal. Motivated by this, we propose Expectation Over Learned distribution of Transformation (EOLT), the framework to treat transformation distribution as a learnable component rather than a fixed design choice.

AUTHORS: Wancheng Feng; Chen An; Zhenliang He; Meina Kan; Shiguang Shan; Lukun Wang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing methods still face two major challenges: their U-Net-based architectures constrain the visual quality of the generated panoramas, and they usually treat the two core tasks independently, which leads to modeling redundancy and inefficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint-face panorama (JoPano) generation approach that unifies the two core tasks within a DiT-based model.

392, TITLE: ESPADA: Execution Speedup Via Semantics Aware Demonstration Data Downsampling for Imitation Learning

AUTHORS: Yahong Wang; Juncheng Wu; Zhangkai Ni; Longzhen Yang; Yihang Liu; Chengmei Yang; Ying Wen; Xianfeng Tang; Hui Liu; Yuyin Zhou; Lianghua He
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While token pruning offers a promising solution for accelerating inference, this paper, however, identifies a key observation: in deeper layers (e.g., beyond the 20th), existing training-free pruning methods perform no better than random pruning. We hypothesize that this degradation is caused by "vanishing token information", where visual tokens progressively lose their salience with increasing network depth.

578, TITLE: Incorporating Structure and Chord Constraints in Symbolic Transformer-based Melodic Harmonization
AUTHORS: Maximos Kaliakatsos-Papakostas; Konstantinos Soiledis; Theodoros Tsamis; Dimos Makris; Vassilis Katsouros; Emilios Cambouropoulos
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.SD [SD]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper studies the inclusion of predefined chord constraints in melodic harmonization, i.e., where a desired chord at a specific location is provided along with the melody as inputs and the autoregressive transformer model needs to incorporate the chord in the harmonization that it generates. The peculiarities of involving such constraints is discussed and an algorithm is proposed for tackling this task.
