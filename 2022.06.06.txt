HIGHLIGHT: We investigate a contact-based approach for enabling unmanned aerial vehicles with cable-suspended passive grippers to compute the attach points on novel payloads for aerial transportation.

84, TITLE: GINK: Graph-based Interaction-aware Kinodynamic Planning Via Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving
AUTHORS: Se-Wook Yoo ; Seung-Woo Seo
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we suggest a new framework that effectively combines graph-based intention representation learning and reinforcement learning for kinodynamic planning.

85, TITLE: Can Requirements Engineering Support Explainable Artificial Intelligence? Towards A User-Centric Approach for Explainability Requirements
AUTHORS: Umm-e-Habiba ; Justus Bogner ; Stefan Wagner
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Explanations help to reduce system opacity, support transparency, and increase stakeholder trust. In this position paper, we discuss synergies between requirements engineering (RE) and Explainable AI (XAI).

86, TITLE: Toward A Realistic Model of Speech Processing in The Brain with Self-supervised Learning
AUTHORS: JULIETTE MILLET et. al.
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: These algorithms, however, remain largely implausible: they require (1) extraordinarily large amounts of data, (2) unobtainable supervised labels, (3) textual rather than raw sensory input, and / or (4) implausibly large memory (e.g. thousands of contextual words). These elements highlight the need to identify algorithms that, under these limitations, would suffice to account for both behavioral and brain responses.

87, TITLE: Biologically-plausible Backpropagation Through Arbitrary Timespans Via Local Neuromodulators
AUTHORS: Yuhan Helena Liu ; Stephen Smith ; Stefan Mihalas ; Eric Shea-Brown ; Uygar Sümbül
CATEGORY: q-bio.NC [q-bio.NC, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we propose that extra-synaptic diffusion of local neuromodulators such as neuropeptides may afford an effective mode of backpropagation lying within the bounds of biological plausibility.

88, TITLE: LenslessPiCam: A Hardware and Software Platform for Lensless Computational Imaging with A Raspberry Pi
AUTHORS: Eric Bezzam ; Sepand Kashani ; Martin Vetterli ; Matthieu Simeoni
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: With LenslessPiCam, we provide an easily accessible hardware and software framework to enable researchers, hobbyists, and students to implement and explore practical and computational aspects of lensless imaging.

89, TITLE: Detecting Pulmonary Embolism from Computed Tomography Using Convolutional Neural Network
AUTHORS: Chia-Hung Yang ; Yun-Chien Cheng ; Chin Kuo
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In the detection process, the cost of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is high, and angiography requires the injection of contrast agents, which increase the risk of damage to the patient. Therefore, this study will use a deep learning approach to detect pulmonary embolism in all patients who take a CT image of the chest using a convolutional neural network.
