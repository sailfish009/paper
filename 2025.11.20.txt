HIGHLIGHT: This leads to our central hypothesis that vision and language possess complementary strengths across distinct reasoning stages: vision supports global pattern abstraction and verification, whereas language specializes in symbolic rule formulation and precise execution. Building on this insight, we introduce two synergistic strategies: (1) Vision-Language Synergy Reasoning (VLSR), which decomposes ARC-AGI into modality-aligned subtasks; and (2) Modality-Switch Self-Correction (MSSC), which leverages vision to verify text-based reasoning for intrinsic error correction.

To tackle these issues, we propose CompTrack, a novel end-to-end framework that systematically eliminates both forms of redundancy in point clouds.

Based on these insights, we propose SplitFlux, which disentangles content and style by fine-tuning the single dream blocks via LoRA, enabling the disentangled content to be re-embedded into new contexts.

AUTHORS: Yuan Jiang; Zehao Li; Shan Huang; Christoph Treude; Xiaohong Su; Tiantian Wang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.SE [SE]

120, TITLE: Representation Space Constrained Learning with Modality Decoupling for Multimodal Object Detection
AUTHORS: YiKang Shao; Tao Shi
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To fill this gap, this paper presents a systematic theoretical investigation of fusion degradation in multimodal detection and identifies two key optimization deficiencies: (1) the gradients of unimodal branch backbones are severely suppressed under multimodal architectures, resulting in under-optimization of the unimodal branches; (2) disparities in modality quality cause weaker modalities to experience stronger gradient suppression, which in turn results in imbalanced modality learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Representation Space Constrained Learning with Modality Decoupling (RSC-MD) method, which consists of two modules.

AUTHORS: Nicoas Zucchet; Qianqian Feng; Axel Laborieux; Friedemann Zenke; Walter Senn; João Sacramento
CATEGORY: arxiv-q-bio.NC [NC]
HIGHLIGHT: However, when these slowly integrating neurons are organized hierarchically, they introduce cumulative delays that create a fundamental challenge for learning: teaching signals that indicate whether behavior was correct or incorrect arrive out-of-sync with the neural activity they are meant to instruct. Here, we demonstrate that neurons enhanced with an adaptive current can compensate for these delays by responding to external stimuli prospectively -- effectively predicting future inputs to synchronize with them.

222, TITLE: Skin-R1: Toward Trustworthy Clinical Reasoning for Dermatological Diagnosis
AUTHORS: Zehao Liu; Wejieying Ren; Jipeng Zhang; Tianxiang Zhao; Jingxi Zhu; Xiaoting Li; Vasant G. Honavar
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, their trustworthiness and clinical utility are often limited by three major factors: (1) Data heterogeneity, where diverse datasets lack consistent diagnostic labels and clinical concept annotations; (2) Absence of grounded diagnostic rationales, leading to a scarcity of reliable reasoning supervision; and (3) Limited scalability and generalization, as models trained on small, densely annotated datasets struggle to transfer nuanced reasoning to large, sparsely-annotated ones. To address these limitations, we propose SkinR1, a novel dermatological VLM that combines deep, textbook-based reasoning with the broad generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL).
