166, TITLE: Denoising Heat-inspired Diffusion with Insulators for Collision Free Motion Planning
AUTHORS: JUNWOO CHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While some of these methods effectively address complex problems, they often depend heavily on inference-time obstacle detection and require additional equipment. Addressing these challenges, we present a method that, during inference time, simultaneously generates only reachable goals and plans motions that avoid obstacles, all from a single visual input.

167, TITLE: Few-Shot In-Context Imitation Learning Via Implicit Graph Alignment
AUTHORS: Vitalis Vosylius ; Edward Johns
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This is challenging because the large variety of objects within a class makes it difficult to infer the task-relevant relationship between the new objects and the objects in the demonstrations. We address this by formulating imitation learning as a conditional alignment problem between graph representations of objects.
