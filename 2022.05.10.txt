CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While these agents excel at generating high-quality responses that are relevant to prior context, they suffer from a lack of awareness of the overall direction in which the conversation is headed, and the likelihood of task success inherent therein. Thus, we propose a framework in which dialogue agents can evaluate the progression of a conversation toward or away from desired outcomes, and use this signal to inform planning for subsequent responses.

22, TITLE: Better Retrieval May Not Lead to Better Question Answering
AUTHORS: Zhengzhong Liang ; Tushar Khot ; Steven Bethard ; Mihai Surdeanu ; Ashish Sabharwal
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: A popular approach to improve the system's performance is to improve the quality of the retrieved context from the IR stage. In this work we show that for StrategyQA, a challenging open-domain QA dataset that requires multi-hop reasoning, this common approach is surprisingly ineffective -- improving the quality of the retrieved context hardly improves the system's performance.
