57, TITLE: Rethinking Explainability in The Era of Multimodal AI
AUTHORS: Chirag Agarwal

This paper argues that such unimodal explanations systematically misrepresent and fail to capture the cross-modal influence that drives multimodal model decisions, and the community should stop relying on them for interpreting multimodal models.

AUTHORS: JEONGHOON PARK et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While existing bias mitigation methods demonstrate effectiveness, they often encounter attribute entanglement, where adjustments to attributes relevant to the bias (i.e., target attributes) unintentionally alter attributes unassociated with the bias (i.e., non-target attributes), causing undesirable distribution shifts. To address this challenge, we introduce Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA), a method that accurately incorporates target attributes (e.g., White, Black, Asian, and Indian) while preserving non-target attributes (e.g., background details) during bias mitigation.

CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this process, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer from one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of immediate availability of all patient information and do not model the interactive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to the limited "out-of-the-box" capabilities of large pre-trained models without performing task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model clinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven uncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis via repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests.

AUTHORS: CHUNJIANG WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, we empirically discover the phenomenon of concept preference variation, that is, the concepts are preferably associated with the features at different layers than those only at the final layer; yet a blind last-layer-based association neglects such a preference variation and thus weakens the accurate correspondences between features and concepts, impairing model interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-layer Visual Preference-enhanced Concept Bottleneck Model (MVP-CBM), which comprises two key novel modules: (1) intra-layer concept preference modeling, which captures the preferred association of different concepts with features at various visual layers, and (2) multi-layer concept sparse activation fusion, which sparsely aggregates concept activations from multiple layers to enhance performance.

To address this challenge, we introduce process reward models (PRMs) into RGS and argue that an ideal PRM should satisfy two objectives: Score Consistency, ensuring coherent evaluation across partial and complete responses, and Preference Consistency, aligning partial sequence assessments with human preferences.

AUTHORS: Ali Asadi ; Krishnendu Chatterjee ; Jakob de Raaij
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.DM]
HIGHLIGHT: Although Howard's algorithm performs well in practice, as experimental studies suggested, the best known upper bound is exponential and the current known lower bound is as follows: For the input size $I$, the algorithm requires $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{I})$ iterations, where $\tilde{\Omega}$ hides the poly-logarithmic factors, i.e., the current lower bound on iterations is sub-linear with respect to the input size. Our main result is an improved lower bound for this fundamental algorithm where we show that for the input size $I$, the algorithm requires $\tilde{\Omega}(I)$ iterations.

HIGHLIGHT: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained via next-word prediction (NWP), which provides strong surface-level fluency but often lacks support for robust reasoning. We propose BOttlenecked next Word exploration (BOW), a novel RL framework that rethinks NWP by introducing a reasoning bottleneck where a policy model first generates a reasoning path rather than predicting the next token directly, after which a frozen judge model predicts the next token distribution based solely on this reasoning path.

Our LRE construction is based on a simple new connection we discover between multiparty communication complexity and non-malleable extractors, which shows that such extractors exhibit strong average-case lower bounds against NOF protocols.

This constant situational awareness and vigilance of adapting world models and counterfactually reasoning about potential system failures and the corresponding best responses, is a core aspect of resilience.

AUTHORS: Zifan Zhao ; Siddhant Haldar ; Jinda Cui ; Lerrel Pinto ; Raunaq Bhirangi
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Data-driven approaches struggle with precise manipulation; imitation learning requires many hard-to-obtain demonstrations, while reinforcement learning yields brittle, non-generalizable policies. We introduce VisuoTactile Local (ViTaL) policy learning, a framework that solves fine-grained manipulation tasks by decomposing them into two phases: a reaching phase, where a vision-language model (VLM) enables scene-level reasoning to localize the object of interest, and a local interaction phase, where a reusable, scene-agnostic ViTaL policy performs contact-rich manipulation using egocentric vision and tactile sensing.

HIGHLIGHT: However, the recent emergence of Large Language Models and Generative Artificial Intelligence now means writing fraudulent or fake reviews is potentially easier than ever. Through three studies we demonstrate that (1) humans are no longer able to distinguish between real and fake product reviews generated by machines, averaging only 50.8% accuracy overall - essentially the same that would be expected by chance alone; (2) that LLMs are likewise unable to distinguish between fake and real reviews and perform equivalently bad or even worse than humans; and (3) that humans and LLMs pursue different strategies for evaluating authenticity which lead to equivalently bad accuracy, but different precision, recall and F1 scores - indicating they perform worse at different aspects of judgment.

AUTHORS: Zaiqiang Wu ; I-Chao Shen ; Takeo Igarashi

CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this context, we define the problem of selecting suitable objects for grasping along with estimating an accurate 6DoF pose of these objects. To address this problem, we propose a camera-IMU based approach that prioritizes unobstructed objects on the higher layers of stacks and introduce a dataset for benchmarking and evaluation, along with a suitable evaluation metric that combines object selection with pose accuracy.

522, TITLE: SPLATART: Articulated Gaussian Splatting with Estimated Object Structure
AUTHORS: Stanley Lewis ; Vishal Chandra ; Tom Gao ; Odest Chadwicke Jenkins
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Complex articulated objects such as robot arms may have seven or more degrees of freedom, and the depth of their kinematic tree may be notably greater than the tools, drawers, and cabinets that are the typical subjects of articulated object research.

523, TITLE: On-board Sonar Data Classification for Path Following in Underwater Vehicles Using Fast Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine
AUTHORS: Adrian Rubio-Solis ; Luciano Nava-Balanzar ; Tomas Salgado-Jimenez
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we apply the concept of Fast Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (FIT2-FELM) to train a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang IT2 Fuzzy Inference System (TSK IT2-FIS) for on-board sonar data classification using an underwater vehicle called BlueROV2.

524, TITLE: Adapting By Analogy: OOD Generalization of Visuomotor Policies Via Functional Correspondence
AUTHORS: Pranay Gupta ; Henny Admoni ; Andrea Bajcsy
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: The key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally correspond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an expert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence.
