2, TITLE: A$^2$Search: Ambiguity-Aware Question Answering with Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Fengji Zhang; Xinyao Niu; Chengyang Ying; Guancheng Lin; Zhongkai Hao; Zhou Fan; Chengen Huang; Jacky Keung; Bei Chen; Junyang Lin
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiplevalid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single goldanswer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end trainingframework to recognize and handle ambiguity.

AUTHORS: Ewin Tang; John Wright; Mark Zhandry

Consequently, for decision tasks, algorithms using (forward and inverse) statepreparation queries only ever perform quadratically better than sample access.These results follow from straightforward combinations of existing techniques;our contribution is to state their consequences in their strongest, mostcounter-intuitive form.

112, TITLE: Causality Guided Representation Learning for Cross-Style Hate Speech Detection
AUTHORS: Chengshuai Zhao; Shu Wan; Paras Sheth; Karan Patwa; K. Selçuk Candan; Huan Liu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: While explicit hate is easily recognized through overtslurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hatespeech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguisticcues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinctgroups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlationsbetween them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hatespeech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextualenvironment, creator motivation, target, and style.
