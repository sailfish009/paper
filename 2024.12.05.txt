CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DC]
HIGHLIGHT: Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain.

237, TITLE: Batch Normalization Decomposed
AUTHORS: Ido Nachum ; Marco Bondaschi ; Michael Gastpar ; Anatoly Khina

238, TITLE: PBP: Post-training Backdoor Purification for Malware Classifiers
AUTHORS: Dung Thuy Nguyen ; Ngoc N. Tran ; Taylor T. Johnson ; Kevin Leach
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR]
HIGHLIGHT: However, these methods are not suitable for scenarios where Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) is used or when users aim to remove backdoors from a model after it has been trained. Addressing this scenario, we introduce PBP, a post-training defense for malware classifiers that mitigates various types of backdoor embeddings without assuming any specific backdoor embedding mechanism.

244, TITLE: Integrating Programmable Plasticity in Experiment Descriptions for Analog Neuromorphic Hardware
AUTHORS: Philipp Spilger ; Eric M�ller ; Johannes Schemmel
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: While previous work on the platform has already reported on the use of different kinds of plasticity, the descriptions for the spiking neural network experiment topology and protocol, and the plasticity algorithm have not been connected. In this work, we introduce an integrated framework for describing spiking neural network experiments and plasticity rules in a unified high-level experiment description language for the BrainScaleS-2 platform and demonstrate its use.

HIGHLIGHT: I present a novel formulation of substitution, where facts about substitution that previously required tens or hundreds of lines to justify in a proof assistant now follow immediately - they can be justified by writing the four letters "refl".

248, TITLE: Proximal Control of UAVs with Federated Learning for Human-Robot Collaborative Domains
AUTHORS: Lucas Nogueira Nobrega ; Ewerton de Oliveira ; Martin Saska ; Tiago Nascimento
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Furthermore, in multi-robot scenarios, distributed training is also an open problem. In this sense, this work proposes an action recognition and control approach based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Neural Networks with two layers in association with three densely connected layers and Federated Learning (FL) embedded in multiple drones.
