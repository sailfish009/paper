111, TITLE: TLCR: Token-Level Continuous Reward for Fine-grained Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
AUTHORS: EUNSEOP YOON et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Although several recent approaches have tried to provide token-level (i.e., dense) rewards for each individual token, these typically rely on predefined discrete reward values (e.g., positive: +1, negative: -1, neutral: 0), failing to account for varying degrees of preference inherent to each token. To address this limitation, we introduce TLCR (Token-Level Continuous Reward) for RLHF, which incorporates a discriminator trained to distinguish positive and negative tokens, and the confidence of the discriminator is used to assign continuous rewards to each token considering the context.
