HIGHLIGHT: To support more robust and reproducible fairness research inFL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods atboth the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways:(1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored toevaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release fourbias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairnessmitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-usefunctions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

230, TITLE: On Convolutions, Intrinsic Dimension, and Diffusion Models
AUTHORS: Kin Kwan Leung ; Rasa Hosseinzadeh ; Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: FLIPD achieves state-of-the-artperformance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incompletesince Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highlyunrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gapby formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions.Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutionsare replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.
