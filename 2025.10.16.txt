HIGHLIGHT: We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptoticperformance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum,and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency withoutmaterially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes followpredictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scaleruns. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, anddemonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validationperformance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Taken together, these signals reveal a recurringpreplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-rangecontextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediatelyfollowed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequentreasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategiesthat dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplantokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistentperformance gains across various reasoning tasks.

AUTHORS: Liyang Hu; Chong Chen

HIGHLIGHT: However, except for errors in the attenuation correctionfactors obtained, the additional scan not only brings in new radiation dosesand/or increases the scanning time but also leads to severe misalignmentinduced by various motions during and between the two sequential scans. Toaddress these issues, based on maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a newmathematical model for simultaneously reconstructing the activity andattenuation sinogram from the time-of-flight (TOF)-PET emission data only.Particularly, we make full use of the exclusively exponential form for theattenuation correction factors, and consider the constraint of a total amountof the activity in some mask region in the proposed model.

HIGHLIGHT: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level or even superiorlanguage abilities, effectively modeling syntactic structures, yet the specificcomputational modules responsible remain unclear. A key question is whether LLMbehavioral capabilities stem from mechanisms akin to those in the human brain.To address these questions, we introduce the Hierarchical Frequency TaggingProbe (HFTP), a tool that utilizes frequency-domain analysis to identifyneuron-wise components of LLMs (e.g., individual Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)neurons) and cortical regions (via intracranial recordings) encoding syntacticstructures.
