AUTHORS: JINHONG WANG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we tackle two challenges arisen in multi-rater annotations for medical image segmentation (called ambiguous medical image segmentation): (1) How to train a deep learning model when a group of raters produces a set of diverse but plausible annotations, and (2) how to fine-tune the model efficiently when computation resources are not available for re-training the entire model on a different dataset domain. We propose a multi-rater prompt-based approach to address these two challenges altogether.

84, TITLE: Fine-Grained Side Information Guided Dual-Prompts for Zero-Shot Skeleton Action Recognition
AUTHORS: Yang Chen ; Jingcai Guo ; Tian He ; Ling Wang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, previous works focus on establishing the bridges between the known skeleton representation space and semantic descriptions space at the coarse-grained level for recognizing unknown action categories, ignoring the fine-grained alignment of these two spaces, resulting in suboptimal performance in distinguishing high-similarity action categories. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method via Side information and dual-prompts learning for skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition (STAR) at the fine-grained level.
