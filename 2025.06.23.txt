AUTHORS: Pavlo Vasylenko ; Marcos Treviso ; Andr� F. T. Martins
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While effective in many settings, this density has been shown to bedetrimental for tasks that demand precise focus on fixed-size patterns: assequence length increases, non-informative tokens accumulate attentionprobability mass, leading to dispersion and representational collapse. We showin this paper that sparse attention mechanisms using $\alpha$-entmax can avoidthese issues, due to their ability to assign exact zeros to irrelevant tokens.Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive-Scalable Entmax (ASEntmax), which endows$\alpha$-entmax with a learnable temperature parameter, allowing the attentiondistribution to interpolate between sparse (pattern-focused) and dense(softmax-like) regimes.

20, TITLE: What Is The Point of Equality in Machine Learning Fairness? Beyond Equality of Opportunity
AUTHORS: Youjin Kong
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CY]
HIGHLIGHT: Whiledistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain whyrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforcesocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --and why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes amultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates bothdistributive and relational equality.

32, TITLE: UniFork: Exploring Modality Alignment for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation
AUTHORS: TENG LI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Our analysis reveals a crucial observation:understanding tasks benefit from a progressively increasing modality alignmentacross network depth, which helps build up semantic information for bettercomprehension; In contrast, generation tasks follow a different trend: modalityalignment increases in the early layers but decreases in the deep layers torecover spatial details. These divergent alignment patterns create afundamental conflict in fully shared Transformer backbones, where a uniformrepresentational flow often leads to performance compromises across two tasks.Motivated by this finding, we introduce UniFork, a novel Y-shaped architecturethat shares the shallow layers for cross-task representation learning, whileemploying task-specific branches in deeper layers to avoid task interference.This design effectively balances shared learning and task specialization.Through extensive ablation experiments, we demonstrate that Uniforkconsistently outperforms conventional fully shared Transformer architectures,and achieves performance on par with or better than task-specific models.

AUTHORS: Vladislav Belozerov ; Peter J Barclay ; Askhan Sami
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Large-language-model coding tools are now mainstream in software engineering.But as these same tools move human effort up the development stack, theypresent fresh dangers: 10% of real prompts leak private data, 42% of generatedsnippets hide security flaws, and the models can even ``agree'' with wrongideas, a trait called sycophancy. We argue that firms must tag and review everyAI-generated line of code, keep prompts and outputs inside private oron-premises deployments, obey emerging safety regulations, and add tests thatcatch sycophantic answers -- so they can gain speed without losing security andaccuracy.

To address this limitation,we introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue,code, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete -identifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue.
