AUTHORS: Florin-Alexandru Vasluianu ; Tim Seizinger ; Zongwei Wu ; Radu Timofte
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing methods oftenoversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform,white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In thispaper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset ofits kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured undermultiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts.Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts,such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion,primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illuminationfrom reflectance.

366, TITLE: KCR: Resolving Long-Context Knowledge Conflicts Via Reasoning in LLMs
AUTHORS: Xianda Zheng ; Zijian Huang ; Meng-Fen Chiang ; Michael J. Witbrock ; Kaiqi Zhao
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: When dealing with conflictsbetween multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledgeconflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. Toaddress this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoningprocess by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context withstronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text orlocal knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts.
