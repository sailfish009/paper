CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, 68T07, 68T10, I.2.6; I.5.1; I.2.7]

To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach called Optimized Gradient Clipping (OGC), which dynamically adjusts the clipping threshold based on the ratio of noise gradients to clean gradients after clipping, estimated by modeling the distributions of clean and noisy samples.

In this work, we present a new task called Word Sense Linking (WSL) where, given an input text and a reference sense inventory, systems have to both identify which spans to disambiguate and then link them to their most suitable meaning.We put forward a transformer-based architecture for the task and thoroughly evaluate both its performance and those of state-of-the-art WSD systems scaled to WSL, iteratively relaxing the assumptions of WSD.

232, TITLE: STORM: A Spatio-Temporal Factor Model Based on Dual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders for Financial Trading
AUTHORS: YILEI ZHAO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods.
