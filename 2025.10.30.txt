AUTHORS: Shannon Zejiang Shen; Valerie Chen; Ken Gu; Alexis Ross; Zixian Ma; Jillian Ross; Alex Gu; Chenglei Si; Wayne Chi; Andi Peng; Jocelyn J Shen; Ameet Talwalkar; Tongshuang Wu; David Sontag
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]

We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completionagents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality oftheir final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effortthroughout the problem-solving process.

15, TITLE: Language Model Behavioral Phases Are Consistent Across Architecture, Training Data, and Scale
AUTHORS: James A. Michaelov; Roger P. Levy; Benjamin K. Bergen
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), trainingdataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistentpatterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based onour analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens ofEnglish, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior atthe word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigramprobability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,and the semantic similarity between the word and its context.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains akey challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced tounderstand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, suchas class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-basedexplanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanisticconcept-explanations.

AUTHORS: Zhigang Tu; Zhengbo Zhang; Jia Gong; Junsong Yuan; Bo Du
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the most representative skeleton sequences may notnecessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model mayhave already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via activelearning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train aninformative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection ofskeleton sequences for annotation.
