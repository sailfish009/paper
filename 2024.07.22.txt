165, TITLE: Seismic Fault SAM: Adapting SAM with Lightweight Modules and 2.5D Strategy for Fault Detection
AUTHORS: Ran Chen ; Zeren Zhang ; Jinwen Ma
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, eess.IV]
HIGHLIGHT: Despite some progress made by automated methods based on deep learning, research in the seismic domain faces significant challenges, particularly because it is difficult to obtain high-quality, large-scale, open-source, and diverse datasets, which hinders the development of general foundation models. Therefore, this paper proposes Seismic Fault SAM, which, for the first time, applies the general pre-training foundation model-Segment Anything Model (SAM)-to seismic fault interpretation.

167, TITLE: The Sticky Path to Expressive Querying: Decidability of Navigational Queries Under Existential Rules
AUTHORS: Piotr Ostropolski-Nalewaja ; Sebastian Rudolph
CATEGORY: cs.DB [cs.DB, cs.AI, cs.LO]
HIGHLIGHT: Extensive research in the field of ontology-based query answering has led to the identification of numerous fragments of existential rules (also known as tuple-generating dependencies) that exhibit decidable answering of atomic and conjunctive queries. Motivated by the increased theoretical and practical interest in navigational queries, this paper considers the question for which of these fragments decidability of querying extends to regular path queries (RPQs).
