79, TITLE: Exploring The Global-to-Local Attention Scheme in Graph Transformers: An Empirical Study
AUTHORS: Zhengwei Wang ; Gang Wu
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captureslong-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may sufferfrom information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNNcould be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer,featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow networklayers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeperlayers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, therebypreventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors.

82, TITLE: MemEvo: Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering
AUTHORS: Zisen Kong ; Bo Zhong ; Pengyuan Li ; Dongxia Chang ; Yiming Wang

HIGHLIGHT: Incremental multi-view clustering aims to achieve stable clustering resultswhile addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma (SPD) in incremental views.At the core of SPD is the challenge that the model must have enough plasticityto quickly adapt to new data, while maintaining sufficient stability toconsolidate long-term knowledge and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Inspiredby the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex collaborative memory mechanism inneuroscience, we propose a Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clusteringmethod (MemEvo) to achieve this balance.

To address these challenges, here we proposea deep learning framework, dubbed Titan, which identifies and freezes inactiveparameters of a given ansatze at initialization for a specific class ofHamiltonians, reducing the optimization overhead without sacrificing accuracy.The motivation of Titan starts with our empirical findings that a subset ofparameters consistently has a negligible influence on training dynamics.

To address these limitations, wepropose a ``Reveal-and-Release'' method to unlearn with self-generated data,where we prompt the model to reveal what it knows using optimized instructions.To fully utilize the self-generated forget data, we propose an iterativeunlearning framework, where we make incremental adjustments to the model'sweight space with parameter-efficient modules trained on the forget data.Experimental results demonstrate that our method balances the tradeoff betweenforget quality and utility preservation.

HIGHLIGHT: Here, we present a deep generativemodel for learning mixtures of latent dynamic models governed by physics-basedPDEs, going beyond traditional approaches that assume a single PDE structure.Our method integrates reaction-diffusion PDEs within a variational autoencoder(VAE) mixture model framework, supporting inference of subtypes ofinterpretable latent variables (e.g. diffusivity and reaction rates) fromneuroimaging data.
