AUTHORS: Deyi Ji; Yuekui Yang; Liqun Liu; Peng Shu; Haiyang Wu; Shaogang Tang; Xudong Chen; Shaoping Ma; Tianrun Chen; Lanyun Zhu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While recent advancements, such as the RAVEN model, have improved coarse-grained violation detection, critical gaps persist in fine-grained understanding, explainability, and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose RAVEN++, a novel framework that introduces three key innovations: 1) Active Reinforcement Learning (RL), which dynamically adapts training to samples of varying difficulty; 2) Fine-Grained Violation Understanding, achieved through hierarchical reward functions and reasoning distillation; and 3) Progressive Multi-Stage Training, which systematically combines knowledge injection, curriculum-based passive RL, and active RL.

AUTHORS: Yasin Esfandiari; Stefan Bauer; Sebastian U. Stich; Andrea Dittadi
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Diffusion models for image generation often exhibit a trade-off between perceptual sample quality and data likelihood: training objectives emphasizing high-noise denoising steps yield realistic images but poor likelihoods, whereas likelihood-oriented training overweights low-noise steps and harms visual fidelity. We introduce a simple plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them along the denoising trajectory.

49, TITLE: Nested Unfolding Network for Real-World Concealed Object Segmentation

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing DUN-based methods (RUN) inherently couple background estimation with image restoration, leading to conflicting objectives and requiring pre-defined degradation types, which are unrealistic in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose the nested unfolding network (NUN), a unified framework for real-world COS.

50, TITLE: UnfoldLDM: Deep Unfolding-based Blind Image Restoration with Latent Diffusion Priors
AUTHORS: Chunming He; Rihan Zhang; Zheng Chen; Bowen Yang; CHengyu Fang; Yunlong Lin; Fengyang Xiao; Sina Farsiu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing DUNs suffer from: (1) \textbf{Degradation-specific dependency}, as their optimization frameworks are tied to a known degradation model, making them unsuitable for BIR tasks; and (2) \textbf{Over-smoothing bias}, resulting from the direct feeding of gradient descent outputs, dominated by low-frequency content, into the proximal term, suppressing fine textures. To overcome these issues, we propose UnfoldLDM to integrate DUNs with latent diffusion model (LDM) for BIR.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although existing methods have progressed from single-modal to multimodal approaches, they face critical limitations: single-modal methods struggle with feature degradation under data compression in social media streaming, while multimodal approaches require expensive data collection and labeling and suffer from inconsistent modal quality or accessibility in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Unimodal-generated Multimodal Contrastive Learning (UMCL) framework for robust cross-compression-rate (CCR) deepfake detection.

AUTHORS: Jaewoo Lee; Archiki Prasad; Justin Chih-Yao Chen; Zaid Khan; Elias Stengel-Eskin; Mohit Bansal
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: While process reward models (PRMs) can guide agents by ranking candidate steps at test-time, existing PRMs, designed for short reasoning with binary judgment, cannot capture richer dimensions of information-seeking steps, such as tool interactions and reasoning over tool outputs, nor handle the rapidly growing context in long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce PRInTS, a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities: (1) dense scoring based on the PRM's reasoning across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g., interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informativeness) and (2) trajectory summarization that compresses the growing context while preserving essential information for step evaluation.

To address this gap, we introduce the Cognitive Alpha Mining Framework (CogAlpha), which combines code-level alpha representation with LLM-driven reasoning and evolutionary search.

103, TITLE: Bias Is A Subspace, Not A Coordinate: A Geometric Rethinking of Post-hoc Debiasing in Vision-Language Models

113, TITLE: Decoupled Audio-Visual Dataset Distillation
AUTHORS: Wenyuan Li; Guang Li; Keisuke Maeda; Takahiro Ogawa; Miki Haseyama
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Subsequent studies have attempted to introduce cross-modal matching, but two major challenges remain: (i) independently and randomly initialized encoders lead to inconsistent modality mapping spaces, increasing training difficulty; and (ii) direct interactions between modalities tend to damage modality-specific (private) information, thereby degrading the quality of the distilled data. To address these challenges, we propose DAVDD, a pretraining-based decoupled audio-visual distillation framework.

126, TITLE: ReEXplore: Improving MLLMs for Embodied Exploration with Contextualized Retrospective Experience Replay
AUTHORS: Gengyuan Zhang; Mingcong Ding; Jingpei Wu; Ruotong Liao; Volker Tresp
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While recent attempts leverage MLLMs for exploration due to their strong perceptual and reasoning abilities, we find that MLLM-based embodied agents remain suboptimal in exploring new environments: (i) they rely on profound but stale pre-trained knowledge, (ii) training-based approaches such as imitation learning or reinforcement learning are expensive for long-horizon tasks with sparse outcome rewards, and (iii) frontier-based exploration yields a large, visually nuanced action space that is difficult for MLLMs to make reliable decisions. We address these challenges with ReEXplore, a training-free framework that performs retrospective experience replay to inject distilled, abstract experience at inference time, and hierarchical frontier selection to decompose frontier ranking into coarse-to-fine decisions.

136, TITLE: NAF: Zero-Shot Feature Upsampling Via Neighborhood Attention Filtering
AUTHORS: Loick Chambon; Paul Couairon; Eloi Zablocki; Alexandre Boulch; Nicolas Thome; Matthieu Cord

AUTHORS: Yingjie Ma; Xun Lin; Yong Xu; Weicheng Xie; Zitong Yu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We identify two key limitations of supervised fine-tuning plus RL (SFT+RL) for multimodal FAS: (1) limited multimodal reasoning paths restrict the use of complementary modalities and shrink the exploration space after SFT, weakening the effect of RL; and (2) mismatched single-task supervision versus diverse reasoning paths causes reasoning confusion, where models may exploit shortcuts by mapping images directly to answers and ignoring the intended reasoning. To address this, we propose PA-FAS, which enhances reasoning paths by constructing high-quality extended reasoning sequences from limited annotations, enriching paths and relaxing exploration constraints.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting based 3D scene representation have shown two major trends: semantics-oriented approaches that focus on high-level understanding but lack explicit 3D geometry modeling, and structure-oriented approaches that capture spatial structures yet provide limited semantic abstraction. To bridge this gap, we present CUS-GS, a compact unified structured Gaussian Splatting representation, which connects multimodal semantic features with structured 3D geometry.

HIGHLIGHT: However, adjusting the camera's focal length or the distance between Gaussian primitives and the camera to modify rendering resolution often introduces strong artifacts, stemming from the frequency constraints of 4D Gaussians and Gaussian scale mismatch induced by the 2D dilated filter. To address this, we derive a maximum sampling frequency formulation for 4D Gaussian Splatting and introduce a 4D scale-adaptive filter and scale loss, which flexibly regulates the sampling frequency of 4D Gaussian Splatting.

HIGHLIGHT: However, existing ICL-based NER methods suffer from three key limitations: (1) reliance on dynamic retrieval of annotated examples, which is problematic when annotated data is scarce; (2) limited generalization to unseen domains due to the LLM's insufficient internal domain knowledge; and (3) failure to incorporate external knowledge or resolve entity ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose KDR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for multi-domain low-resource in-context NER that integrates Knowledge retrieval, Disambiguation, and Reflective analysis.

AUTHORS: Yifan He; Haodong Zhang; Qiuheng Song; Lin Lei; Zhenxuan Zeng; Haoyang He; Hongyan Wu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, practical DFOS systems face three critical challenges: (1) signal patterns of the same activity vary drastically under different fiber deployment types (e.g., underground, wall-mounted), causing domain shift; (2) labeled data in new deployment scenarios is often scarce or entirely unavailable, limiting model adaptability; and (3) even within source domains, data scarcity makes it difficult to capture intra-class diversity for robust learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning framework, DUPLE, for cross-deployment DFOS activity identification.
