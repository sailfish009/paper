HIGHLIGHT: Continual Structured Knowledge Reasoning (CSKR) focuses on training models tohandle sequential tasks, where each task involves translating natural languagequestions into structured queries grounded in structured knowledge. Existinggeneral continual learning approaches face significant challenges when appliedto this task, including poor generalization to heterogeneous structuredknowledge and inefficient reasoning due to parameter growth as tasks increase.To address these limitations, we propose a novel CSKR framework,\textsc{K-DeCore}, which operates with a fixed number of tunable parameters.Unlike prior methods, \textsc{K-DeCore} introduces a knowledge decouplingmechanism that disentangles the reasoning process into task-specific andtask-agnostic stages, effectively bridging the gaps across diverse tasks.Building on this foundation, \textsc{K-DeCore} integrates a dual-perspectivememory consolidation mechanism for distinct stages and introduces astructure-guided pseudo-data synthesis strategy to further enhance the model'sgeneralization capabilities.

518, TITLE: Development of A Mobile Application for At-Home Analysis of Retinal Fundus Images
AUTHORS: Mattea Reid ; Zuhairah Zainal ; Khaing Zin Than ; Danielle Chan ; Jonathan Chan
CATEGORY: cs.HC [cs.HC, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Machine learning is gaining significant attention as a diagnostic tool inmedical imaging, particularly in the analysis of retinal fundus images.However, this approach is not yet clinically applicable, as it still depends onhuman validation from a professional. Therefore, we present the design for amobile application that monitors metrics related to retinal fundus imagescorrelating to age-related conditions.

519, TITLE: The Role of Vocabularies in Learning Sparse Representations for Ranking
AUTHORS: Hiun Kim ; Tae Kwan Lee ; Taeryun Won
CATEGORY: cs.IR [cs.IR, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: A recent work on learning SPLADE models with expanded vocabularies(ESPLADE) was proposed to represent queries and documents into a sparse spaceof custom vocabulary which have different levels of vocabularic granularity.Within this effort, however, there have not been many studies on the role ofvocabulary in SPLADE models and their relationship to retrieval efficiency andeffectiveness. To study this, we construct BERT models with 100K-sized output vocabularies,one initialized with the ESPLADE pretraining method and one initializedrandomly.

522, TITLE: Gradient Interference-Aware Graph Coloring for Multitask Learning
AUTHORS: Santosh Patapati ; Trisanth Srinivasan
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning,gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby reducing the finalmodel's performance. To address this, we introduce a scheduler that computesgradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then appliesgreedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with eachother.

525, TITLE: Adaptive Kernel Design for Bayesian Optimization Is A Piece of CAKE with LLMs
AUTHORS: RICHARD CORNELIUS SUWANDI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Traditional BOmethods often rely on fixed or heuristic kernel selection strategies, which canresult in slow convergence or suboptimal solutions when the chosen kernel ispoorly suited to the underlying objective function. To address this limitation,we propose a freshly-baked Context-Aware Kernel Evolution (CAKE) to enhance BOwith large language models (LLMs).
