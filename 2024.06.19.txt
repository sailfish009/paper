AUTHORS: Miaoyu Li ; Haoxin Li ; Zilin Du ; Boyang Li
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Current zero-shot K-VQA methods usually translate an image to a single type of textual decision context and use a text-based model to answer the question based on it, which conflicts with the fact that K-VQA questions often require the combination of multiple question-answering strategies. In light of this, we propose Rationale-based Ensemble of Answer Context Tactics (REACT) to achieve a dynamic ensemble of multiple question-answering tactics, comprising Answer Candidate Generation (ACG) and Rationale-based Strategy Fusion (RSF).

HIGHLIGHT: Most existing deep learning-based registration methods are trained on single-type images to address same-domain tasks.However, cross-domain deformable registration remains challenging.We argue that the tailor-made matching criteria in traditional registration methods is one of the main reason they are applicable in different domains.Motivated by this, we devise a registration-oriented encoder to model the matching criteria of image features and structural features, which is beneficial to boost registration accuracy and adaptability.Specifically, a general feature encoder (Encoder-G) is proposed to capture comprehensive medical image features, while a structural feature encoder (Encoder-S) is designed to encode the structural self-similarity into the global representation.Extensive experiments on images from three different domains prove the efficacy of the proposed method.
