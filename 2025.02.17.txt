Teachers in the study advocated for supporting their professional growth and augmenting their current roles without replacing them.

159, TITLE: A Hybrid Cross-Stage Coordination Pre-ranking Model for Online Recommendation Systems
AUTHORS: BINGLEI ZHAO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.IR [cs.IR, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: To address the limitation, we propose a novel Hybrid Cross-Stage Coordination Pre-ranking model (HCCP) to integrate information from upstream (retrieval) and downstream (ranking, re-ranking) stages.

160, TITLE: On Space Folds of ReLU Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Michal Lewandowski ; Hamid Eghbalzadeh ; Bernhard Heinzl ; Raphael Pisoni ; Bernhard A. Moser
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Recent findings suggest that the consecutive layers of ReLU neural networks can be understood geometrically as space folding transformations of the input space, revealing patterns of self-similarity. In this paper, we present the first quantitative analysis of this space folding phenomenon in ReLU neural networks.

161, TITLE: ExplainReduce: Summarising Local Explanations Via Proxies
AUTHORS: Lauri Sepp�l�inen ; Mudong Guo ; Kai Puolam�ki

162, TITLE: Dynamic Reinforcement Learning for Actors
AUTHORS: Katsunari Shibata
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Dynamic Reinforcement Learning (Dynamic RL), proposed in this paper, directly controls system dynamics, instead of the actor (action-generating neural network) outputs at each moment, bringing about a major qualitative shift in reinforcement learning (RL) from static to dynamic.

165, TITLE: Differential Adjusted Parity for Learning Fair Representations
AUTHORS: Bucher Sahyouni ; Matthew Vowels ; Liqun Chen ; Simon Hadfield

HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we develop SALDAE, a multiagent path finding algorithm for CSG that operates on a graph of coalition structures.

167, TITLE: Open-Source AI-Powered Optimization in Scalene: Advancing Python Performance Profiling with DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA 3.2
AUTHORS: Saem Hasan ; Sanju Basak

HIGHLIGHT: This study explores the feasibility of using opensource large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 and Llama 3.2, to generate optimization recommendations within SCALENE.

168, TITLE: Adaptive Bi-Level Multi-Robot Task Allocation and Learning Under Uncertainty with Temporal Logic Constraints
AUTHORS: Xiaoshan Lin ; Roberto Tron
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.FL]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a bi-level framework that integrates (i) high-level task allocation, where tasks are assigned based on the robots' estimated task completion probabilities and expected rewards, and (ii) low-level distributed policy learning and execution, where robots independently optimize auxiliary rewards while fulfilling their assigned tasks.

169, TITLE: PUGS: Perceptual Uncertainty for Grasp Selection in Underwater Environments
AUTHORS: Onur Bagoren ; Marc Micatka ; Katherine A. Skinner ; Aaron Marburg
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: When navigating and interacting in challenging environments where sensory information is imperfect and incomplete, robots must make decisions that account for these shortcomings. We propose a novel method for quantifying and representing such perceptual uncertainty in 3D reconstruction through occupancy uncertainty estimation.
