1, TITLE: Challenges and Research Directions for Large Language Model Inference Hardware
AUTHORS: Xiaoyu Ma ; David Patterson
CATEGORY: cs.AR [cs.AR, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Exacerbated by recent AI trends, the primary challenges are memory and interconnect rather than compute. To address these challenges, we highlight four architecture research opportunities: High Bandwidth Flash for 10X memory capacity with HBM-like bandwidth; Processing-Near-Memory and 3D memory-logic stacking for high memory bandwidth; and low-latency interconnect to speedup communication.

2, TITLE: GDPO: Group Reward-Decoupled Normalization Policy Optimization for Multi-reward RL Optimization
AUTHORS: SHIH-YANG LIU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, recent work has defaulted to apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) under multi-reward setting without examining its suitability. In this paper, we demonstrate that directly applying GRPO to normalize distinct rollout reward combinations causes them to collapse into identical advantage values, reducing the resolution of the training signal and resulting in suboptimal convergence and, in some cases, early training failure.

71, TITLE: Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection
AUTHORS: Jiayu Ding ; Haoran Tang ; Ge Li
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity.
