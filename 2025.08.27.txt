HIGHLIGHT: Furthermore, they are susceptibleto overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond theimmediate task context. To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-EnhancedMeta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) amemory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-levelreflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin toTextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-runoptimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.

CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this review,we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signalprocessing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role intheoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs,including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computationalhardness, generalization, and identifiability.

228, TITLE: HAEPO: History-Aggregated Exploratory Policy Optimization
AUTHORS: GAURISH TRIVEDI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, both oftenlimit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-AggregatedExploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss tocombat these shortcomings.

229, TITLE: Skill-Aligned Fairness in Multi-Agent Learning for Collaboration in Healthcare
AUTHORS: PROMISE OSAINE EKPO et. al.

230, TITLE: Leveraging Evolutionary Surrogate-Assisted Prescription in Multi-Objective Chlorination Control Systems
AUTHORS: Rivaaj Monsia ; Olivier Francon ; Daniel Young ; Risto Miikkulainen
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This short, written report introduces the idea of EvolutionarySurrogate-Assisted Prescription (ESP) and presents preliminary results on itspotential use in training real-world agents as a part of the 1st AI forDrinking Water Chlorination Challenge at IJCAI-2025.

231, TITLE: Mining The Long Tail: A Comparative Study of Data-Centric Criticality Metrics for Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Motion Planning
AUTHORS: Antonio Guillen-Perez
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundanescenarios vastly outnumber rare "long-tail" events, leads to brittle and unsafepolicies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we addressthis challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of datacuration strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-richsamples.

232, TITLE: Uncertainty-Resilient Active Intention Recognition for Robotic Assistants
AUTHORS: JUAN CARLOS SABORï¿½O et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In response, we present a framework designed to be resilient touncertainty and sensor noise, integrating real-time sensor data with acombination of planners.

233, TITLE: Real-Time Model Checking for Closed-Loop Robot Reactive Planning
AUTHORS: Christopher Chandler ; Bernd Porr ; Giulia Lafratta ; Alice Miller
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.FL, I.2.9; I.2; D.2.4]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a new application of model checking which achieves real-timemulti-step planning and obstacle avoidance on a real autonomous robot.

234, TITLE: Enhancing Video-Based Robot Failure Detection Using Task Knowledge
AUTHORS: Santosh Thoduka ; Sebastian Houben ; Juergen Gall ; Paul G. Plï¿½ger
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Inthis paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that usesspatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs andtask-relevant objects within the field of view.

235, TITLE: Enhanced UAV Path Planning Using The Tangent Intersection Guidance (TIG) Algorithm
AUTHORS: Hichem Cheriet ; Khellat Kihel Badra ; Chouraqui Samira
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces the Tangent Intersection Guidance(TIG) algorithm, an advanced approach for UAV path planning in both static anddynamic environments.

236, TITLE: SwiftF0: Fast and Accurate Monophonic Pitch Detection
AUTHORS: Lars Nieradzik
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.LG, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: To address thecritical lack of perfectly accurate ground truth pitch in speech corpora (whichtypically rely on algorithmic estimators or laryngograph signals), we introduce\emph{SpeechSynth}.

237, TITLE: SegReConcat: A Data Augmentation Method for Voice Anonymization Attack
AUTHORS: Ridwan Arefeen ; Xiaoxiao Miao ; Rong Tong ; Aik Beng Ng ; Simon See
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, residual speaker cues oftenpersist, which pose privacy risks. We propose SegReConcat, a data augmentationmethod for attacker-side enhancement of automatic speaker verification systems.SegReConcat segments anonymized speech at the word level, rearranges segmentsusing random or similarity-based strategies to disrupt long-term contextualcues, and concatenates them with the original utterance, allowing an attackerto learn source speaker traits from multiple perspectives.
