AUTHORS: KIBOK LEE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Our empirical results show several key factors that have not been explored in previous works: 1) contrary to previous belief, on a multi-domain benchmark, fine-tuning (FT) is a strong baseline for FSOD, performing on par or better than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms; 2) utilizing FT as the baseline allows us to explore multiple architectures, and we found them to have a significant impact on down-stream few-shot tasks, even with similar pre-training performances; 3) by decoupling pre-training and few-shot learning, MoFSOD allows us to explore the impact of different pre-training datasets, and the right choice can boost the performance of the down-stream tasks significantly. Based on these findings, we list possible avenues of investigation for improving FSOD performance and propose two simple modifications to existing algorithms that lead to SOTA performance on the MoFSOD benchmark.

85, TITLE: Strategising Template-guided Needle Placement for MR-targeted Prostate Biopsy
AUTHORS: Iani JMB Gayo ; Shaheer U. Saeed ; Dean C. Barratt ; Matthew J. Clarkson ; Yipeng Hu
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV, eess.IV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the diagnostic accuracy of the biopsy procedure is limited by the operator-dependent skills and experience in sampling the targets, a sequential decision making process that involves navigating an ultrasound probe and placing a series of sampling needles for potentially multiple targets. This work aims to learn a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that optimises the actions of continuous positioning of 2D ultrasound views and biopsy needles with respect to a guiding template, such that the MR targets can be sampled efficiently and sufficiently.

90, TITLE: Discrete Key-Value Bottleneck
AUTHORS: FREDERIK TRÄUBLE et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]

To solve this problem, we propose a new TV-type regularization called Graph-SSTV (GSSTV), which generates a graph explicitly reflecting the spatial structure of the target HSI from noisy HSIs and incorporates a weighted spatial difference operator designed based on this graph.
