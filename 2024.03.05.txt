Here, we address both of these limitations by regularizing the curvature of manifolds generated by variational autoencoders, a process we coin ``$\Gamma$-VAE''.

AUTHORS: Ziting Wen ; Oscar Pizarro ; Stefan Williams
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we argue the performance drop stems not only from pre-computed features' inability to distinguish between categories of labeled samples, resulting in the selection of redundant samples but also from the tendency to compromise valuable pre-trained information when fine-tuning with samples selected through the proxy model. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called aligned selection via proxy to update pre-computed features while selecting a proper training method to inherit valuable pre-training information.
