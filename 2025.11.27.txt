AUTHORS: Teng Hu; Zhentao Yu; Guozhen Zhang; Zihan Su; Zhengguang Zhou; Youliang Zhang; Yuan Zhou; Qinglin Lu; Ran Yi
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization.

AUTHORS: Xiaoyue Mi; Wenqing Yu; Jiesong Lian; Shibo Jie; Ruizhe Zhong; Zijun Liu; Guozhen Zhang; Zixiang Zhou; Zhiyong Xu; Yuan Zhou; Qinglin Lu; Fan Tang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities.

219, TITLE: Referring Video Object Segmentation with Cross-Modality Proxy Queries
AUTHORS: Baoli Sun; Xinzhu Ma; Ning Wang; Zhihui Wang; Zhiyong Wang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them.

HIGHLIGHT: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch.

240, TITLE: Subgoal Graph-Augmented Planning for LLM-Guided Open-World Reinforcement Learning
AUTHORS: Shanwei Fan
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals.

To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Task Interaction adversarial learning Network (MTI-Net), a novel integrated framework designed to tackle these tasks simultaneously.

306, TITLE: Criminal Code Reform During The AI Revolution to Counter The New Form of Colonialism of Indigenous Peoples
AUTHORS: Ehsan Jozaghi

507, TITLE: PG-ControlNet: A Physics-Guided ControlNet for Generative Spatially Varying Image Deblurring
AUTHORS: Hakki Motorcu; Mujdat Cetin
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints.
