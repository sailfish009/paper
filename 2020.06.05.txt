http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01174
AUTHORS:        Maria de la Iglesia Vayá ; Jose Manuel Saborit ; Joaquim Angel Montell ; Antonio Pertusa ; Aurelia Bustos ; Miguel Cazorla ; Joaquin Galant ; Xavier Barber ; Domingo Orozco-Beltrán ; Francisco García-García ; Marisa Caparrós ; Germán González ; Jose María Salinas
HIGHLIGHT:      This paper describes BIMCV COVID-19+, a large dataset from the Valencian Region Medical ImageBank (BIMCV) containing chest X-ray images CXR (CR, DX) and computed tomography (CT) imaging of COVID-19+ patients along with their radiological findings and locations, pathologies, radiological reports (in Spanish), DICOM metadata, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) diagnostic antibody tests.

51, TITLE:      Unsupervised Image Noise Modeling with Self-Consistent GAN
http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05762
AUTHORS:        Hanshu Yan ; Xuan Chen ; Vincent Y. F. Tan ; Wenhan Yang ; Joe Wu ; Jiashi Feng
HIGHLIGHT:      To ameliorate this problem, we propose a self-consistent GAN (SCGAN), that can directly extract noise maps from noisy images, thus enabling unsupervised noise modeling.

52, TITLE:      Directly Mapping RDF Databases to Property Graph Databases
http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02127
AUTHORS:        Renzo Angles ; Harsh Thakkar ; Dominik Tomaszuk
COMMENTS:       This work has been accepted and published at the IEEE Access Journal DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2993117
HIGHLIGHT:      This paper presents three direct mappings (schema-dependent and schema-independent) for transforming an RDF database into a property graph database, including data and schema.
