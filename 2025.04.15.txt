AUTHORS: Songze Li ; Qixing Xu ; Tonghua Su ; Xu-Yao Zhang ; Zhongjie Wang

HIGHLIGHT: Through systematic component-wise analysis of pretrained detectors, we reveal a fundamental discrepancy: the localization modules demonstrate inherent cross-domain stability-preserving precise bounding box estimation across distribution shifts-while the classification components require enhanced plasticity to mitigate discriminability degradation in cross-domain scenarios. Motivated by these findings, we propose a dual-path framework built upon pretrained DETR-based detectors which decouples localization stability and classification plasticity: the localization path maintains stability to preserve pretrained localization knowledge, while the classification path facilitates plasticity via parameter-efficient fine-tuning and resists forgetting with pseudo-feature replay.

To address these limitations, we introduce Contrastive Prompt Learning (CPL), a novel framework that fundamentally enhances prompt-task alignment through two complementary innovations: a \emph{Sparse Prompt Module (SPM)} that efficiently captures degradation-specific features while minimizing redundancy, and a \emph{Contrastive Prompt Regularization (CPR)} that explicitly strengthens task boundaries by incorporating negative prompt samples across different degradation types.

373, TITLE: Large Language Models As Particle Swarm Optimizers
AUTHORS: Yamato Shinohara ; Jinglue Xu ; Tianshui Li ; Hitoshi Iba
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Recently, several approaches have gained attention by integrating large language models (LLMs) into genetic algorithms. Building on this trend, we introduce Language Model Particle Swarm Optimization (LMPSO), a novel method that incorporates an LLM into the swarm intelligence framework of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

374, TITLE: Universal Algebra and Effectful Computation
AUTHORS: Nayan Rajesh
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, math.CT]
HIGHLIGHT: Abstract clones serve as an algebraic presentation of the syntax of a simple type theory. From the perspective of universal algebra, they define algebraic theories like those of groups, monoids and rings.

375, TITLE: Joint Action Language Modelling for Transparent Policy Execution
AUTHORS: Theodor Wulff ; Rahul Singh Maharjan ; Xinyun Chi ; Angelo Cangelosi
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We aim to insert transparent behavior directly into the learning process, by transforming the problem of policy learning into a language generation problem and combining it with traditional autoregressive modelling.

376, TITLE: Migrating Code At Scale With LLMs At Google
AUTHORS: CELAL ZIFTCI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we discuss a large-scale, costly and traditionally manual migration project at Google, propose a novel automated algorithm that uses change location discovery and a Large Language Model (LLM) to aid developers conduct the migration, report the results of a large case study, and discuss lessons learned.

377, TITLE: Adaptive Robustness of Hypergrid Johnson-Lindenstrauss
AUTHORS: Andrej Bogdanov ; Alon Rosen ; Neekon Vafa ; Vinod Vaikuntanathan
CATEGORY: stat.CO [stat.CO, cs.CC, cs.DS]
HIGHLIGHT: On the algorithmic side, we design an online algorithm achieving $\kappa_{\mathsf{comp}}$, inspired by a discrepancy minimization algorithm of Bansal and Spencer (Random Structures & Algorithms, 2020).

378, TITLE: Offline Dynamic Inventory and Pricing Strategy: Addressing Censored and Dependent Demand
AUTHORS: Korel Gundem ; Zhengling Qi
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, math.ST, stat.AP, stat.TH, 90B05, 68T05, 90C40, 62N02]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we study the offline sequential feature-based pricing and inventory control problem where the current demand depends on the past demand levels and any demand exceeding the available inventory is lost.

379, TITLE: Towards Contrast- and Pathology-agnostic Clinical Fetal Brain MRI Segmentation Using SynthSeg
AUTHORS: ZIYAO SHANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we aim to train networks capable of automatically segmenting fetal brain MRIs with a wide range of domain shifts pertaining to differences in subject physiology and acquisition environments, in particular shape-based differences commonly observed in pathological cases.

380, TITLE: OmniMamba4D: Spatio-temporal Mamba for Longitudinal CT Lesion Segmentation
AUTHORS: JUSTIN NAMUK KIM et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing 3D segmentation models solely focus on spatial information. To address this gap, we propose OmniMamba4D, a novel segmentation model designed for 4D medical images (3D images over time).

381, TITLE: Progressive Transfer Learning for Multi-Pass Fundus Image Restoration
AUTHORS: Uyen Phan ; Ozer Can Devecioglu ; Serkan Kiranyaz ; Moncef Gabbouj
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we propose progressive transfer learning for multi pass restoration to iteratively enhance the quality of degraded fundus images, ensuring more reliable DR screening.
