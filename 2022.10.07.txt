Therefore, we propose Causal-Enhance Module (CEM) by establishing the causal graph of MHCH based on these two variables, which is a simple yet effective module and can be easy to plug into the existing MHCH methods.

6, TITLE: Fault Diagnosis Using EXplainable AI: A Transfer Learning-based Approach for Rotating Machinery Exploiting Augmented Synthetic Data
AUTHORS: Lucas Costa Brito ; Gian Antonio Susto Jorge Nei Brito ; Marcus Antonio Viana Duarte
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Another limitating factor for the applicability of AI approaches in this context is the lack of interpretability of the models (black-boxes), which reduces the confidence of the diagnosis and trust/adoption from users. To overcome these problems, a new generic and interpretable approach for classifying faults in rotating machinery based on transfer learning from augmented synthetic data to real rotating machinery is here proposed, namelly FaultD-XAI (Fault Diagnosis using eXplainable AI).

AUTHORS: Vinodkumar Prabhakaran ; Margaret Mitchell ; Timnit Gebru ; Iason Gabriel
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.CY]

15, TITLE: Binding Language Models in Symbolic Languages
AUTHORS: ZHOUJUN CHENG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Though end-to-end neural approaches have recently been dominating NLP tasks in both performance and ease-of-use, they lack interpretability and robustness. We propose Binder, a training-free neural-symbolic framework that maps the task input to a program, which (1) allows binding a unified API of language model (LM) functionalities to a programming language (e.g., SQL, Python) to extend its grammar coverage and thus tackle more diverse questions, (2) adopts an LM as both the program parser and the underlying model called by the API during execution, and (3) requires only a few in-context exemplar annotations.

17, TITLE: MuRAG: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generator for Open Question Answering Over Images and Text
AUTHORS: Wenhu Chen ; Hexiang Hu ; Xi Chen ; Pat Verga ; William W. Cohen
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, these methods are restricted to retrieving only textual knowledge, neglecting the ubiquitous amount of knowledge in other modalities like images -- much of which contains information not covered by any text. To address this limitation, we propose the first Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Transformer (MuRAG), which accesses an external non-parametric multimodal memory to augment language generation.

18, TITLE: U3E: Unsupervised and Erasure-based Evidence Extraction for Machine Reading Comprehension
AUTHORS: Suzhe He ; Shumin Shi ; Chenghao Wu

HIGHLIGHT: While Self-Supervised Learning has helped reap the benefit of the scale from the available unlabeled data, the learning paradigms are continuously being bettered. We present a new pre-training strategy named ccc-wav2vec 2.0, which uses clustering and an augmentation-based cross-contrastive loss as its self-supervised objective.

20, TITLE: Generative Entity Typing with Curriculum Learning
AUTHORS: SIYU YUAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: The traditional classification-based entity typing paradigm has two unignorable drawbacks: 1) it fails to assign an entity to the types beyond the predefined type set, and 2) it can hardly handle few-shot and zero-shot situations where many long-tail types only have few or even no training instances. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel generative entity typing (GET) paradigm: given a text with an entity mention, the multiple types for the role that the entity plays in the text are generated with a pre-trained language model (PLM).

To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Ranking-based Sample Selection (ARS2), a model-agnostic framework to alleviate the data imbalance issue in the WS paradigm.

23, TITLE: How Far Are We from Real Synonym Substitution Attacks?

37, TITLE: Attention-based Ingredient Phrase Parser
AUTHORS: Zhengxiang Shi ; Pin Ni ; Meihui Wang ; To Eun Kim ; Aldo Lipani
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing ingredient information scraped from the cooking website is in the unstructured form with huge variation in the lexical structure, for example, '1 garlic clove, crushed', and '1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened', making it difficult to extract information exactly. To provide an engaged and successful conversational service to users for cooking tasks, we propose a new ingredient parsing model that can parse an ingredient phrase of recipes into the structure form with its corresponding attributes with over 0.93 F1-score.

AUTHORS: Garam Lee ; Minsoo Kim ; Jai Hyun Park ; Seung-won Hwang ; Jung Hee Cheon
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, recent research has shown that embeddings can potentially leak private information about sensitive attributes of the text, and in some cases, can be inverted to recover the original input text. To address these growing privacy challenges, we propose a privatization mechanism for embeddings based on homomorphic encryption, to prevent potential leakage of any piece of information in the process of text classification.

AUTHORS: Ping Xue ; Yang Lu ; Jingfei Chang ; Xing Wei ; Zhen Wei
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing optimization methods for binary neural networks (BNNs) focus on fitting full-precision networks to reduce quantization errors, and suffer from the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. In contrast, considering the limited learning ability and information loss caused by the limited representational capability of BNNs, we propose IR$^2$Net to stimulate the potential of BNNs and improve the network accuracy by restricting the input information and recovering the feature information, including: 1) information restriction: for a BNN, by evaluating the learning ability on the input information, discarding some of the information it cannot focus on, and limiting the amount of input information to match its learning ability; 2) information recovery: due to the information loss in forward propagation, the output feature information of the network is not enough to support accurate classification.
