160, TITLE: Reduction Strategies in The Lambda Calculus and Their Implementation Through Derivable Abstract Machines: Introduction
AUTHORS: Tomasz Drab
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: This article is an introduction to a dissertation is composed of four conference papers where: we present a systematic survey of reduction strategies of the lambda calculus; we take advantage of the functional correspondence as a tool for studying implementations of the lambda calculus by deriving an abstract machine for a precisely identified strong call-by-value reduction strategy; we improve it to obtain an efficient abstract machine for strong call by value and provide a time complexity analysis for the new machine with the use of a potential function; and we present the first provably efficient abstract machine for strong call by need.
