HIGHLIGHT: In this article, we introduce an extended version of Channel-Prior and Gamma-Estimation Network (CPGA-Net), termed CPGA-Net+, which incorporates an attention mechanism driven by a reformulated Atmospheric Scattering Model and effectively addresses both global and local image processing through Plug-in Attention with gamma correction.

317, TITLE: NapTune: Efficient Model Tuning for Mood Classification Using Previous Night's Sleep Measures Along with Wearable Time-series
AUTHORS: Debaditya Shome ; Nasim Montazeri Ghahjaverestan ; Ali Etemad
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: To this end, we propose NapTune, a novel prompt-tuning framework that utilizes sleep-related measures as additional inputs to a frozen pre-trained wearable time-series encoder by adding and training lightweight prompt parameters to each Transformer layer.
