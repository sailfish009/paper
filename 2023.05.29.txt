1, TITLE: Pair-Variational Autoencoders (PairVAE) for Linking and Cross-Reconstruction of Characterization Data from Complementary Structural Characterization Techniques
AUTHORS: Shizhao Lu ; Arthi Jayaraman

HIGHLIGHT: Thus, it is useful to have machine learning models that can be trained on paired structural characterization data from multiple techniques so that the model can generate one set of characterization data from the other. In this paper we demonstrate one such machine learning workflow, PairVAE, that works with data from Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) that presents information about bulk morphology and images from Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) that presents two-dimensional local structural information of the sample.

AUTHORS: Dominik Machá?ek ; Peter Polák ; Ond?ej Bojar ; Raj Dabre

37, TITLE: Impossible Distillation: from Low-Quality Model to High-Quality Dataset & Model for Summarization and Paraphrasing
AUTHORS: JAEHUN JUNG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: It is commonly perceived that the strongest language models (LMs) rely on a combination of massive scale, instruction data, and human feedback to perform specialized tasks -- e.g. summarization and paraphrasing, without supervision. In this paper, we propose that language models can learn to summarize and paraphrase sentences, with none of these 3 factors.

38, TITLE: Are Fairy Tales Fair? Analyzing Gender Bias in Temporal Narrative Event Chains of Children's Fairy Tales

We propose a computational pipeline that automatically extracts a story's temporal narrative verb-based event chain for each of its characters as well as character attributes such as gender.

39, TITLE: RFiD: Towards Rational Fusion-in-Decoder for Open-Domain Question Answering
AUTHORS: Cunxiang Wang ; Haofei Yu ; Yue Zhang
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Although representative models like Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) have been proposed to address this challenge, these systems can inadvertently rely on spurious features instead of genuine causal relationships between the question and the passages to generate answers. To counter this problem, we introduce the Rational Fusion-in-Decoder (RFiD) model.

40, TITLE: Large Language Models Are Partially Primed in Pronoun Interpretation
AUTHORS: Suet-Ying Lam ; Qingcheng Zeng ; Kexun Zhang ; Chenyu You ; Rob Voigt
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: The present study probes this question by asking whether LLMs display human-like referential biases using stimuli and procedures from real psycholinguistic experiments. Recent psycholinguistic studies suggest that humans adapt their referential biases with recent exposure to referential patterns; closely replicating three relevant psycholinguistic experiments from Johnson & Arnold (2022) in an in-context learning (ICL) framework, we found that InstructGPT adapts its pronominal interpretations in response to the frequency of referential patterns in the local discourse, though in a limited fashion: adaptation was only observed relative to syntactic but not semantic biases.

Using three different tasks, involving both naturalistic social media data and constructed examples, we investigate the extent to which BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2 and GPT-3 exhibit general, human-like, knowledge of these common words.

AUTHORS: Minqian Liu ; Lifu Huang
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This fundamental challenge, however, has not yet been studied extensively, especially in the setting where no samples from old classes are stored for rehearsal. In this paper, we take a closer look at how the drift in the classifier leads to forgetting, and accordingly, design four simple yet (super-) effective solutions to alleviate the classifier drift: an Individual Classifiers with Frozen Feature Extractor (ICE) framework where we individually train a classifier for each learning session, and its three variants ICE-PL, ICE-O, and ICE-PL&O which further take the logits of previously learned classes from old sessions or a constant logit of an Other class as a constraint to the learning of new classifiers.

78, TITLE: Counterfactual Probing for The Influence of Affect and Specificity on Intergroup Bias
AUTHORS: Venkata S Govindarajan ; Kyle Mahowald ; David I. Beaver ; Junyi Jessy Li
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.CY]
HIGHLIGHT: While existing work on studying bias in NLP focues on negative or pejorative language use, Govindarajan et al. (2023) offer a revised framing of bias in terms of intergroup social context, and its effects on language behavior. In this paper, we investigate if two pragmatic features (specificity and affect) systematically vary in different intergroup contexts -- thus connecting this new framing of bias to language output.

In this paper we introduce Temporal C4.5, that allows the extraction of temporal decision trees from undiscretized multivariate time series, describe its implementation, called Temporal J48, and discuss the outcome of a set of experiments with the latter on a collection of public data sets, comparing the results with those obtained by other, classical, multivariate time series classification methods.

We overcome this limitation by proposing a novel two-step method for inferring partitions, which allows its usage in variational inference tasks.

Combining these decoding techniques with interference cancellation ideas from communications improves previously reported bounds (Hersche et al., 2021) of the information rate of the distributed representations from 1.20 to 1.40 bits per dimension for smaller codebooks and from 0.60 to 1.26 bits per dimension for larger codebooks.

221, TITLE: NODDLE: Node2vec Based Deep Learning Model for Link Prediction
AUTHORS: Kazi Zainab Khanam ; Aditya Singhal ; Vijay Mago
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Although deep learning techniques and network representation learning algorithms, such as node2vec, show remarkable improvements in prediction accuracy, the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method of node2vec tends to fall into a mediocre local optimum value due to a shortage of prior network information, resulting in failure to capture the global structure of the network. To tackle this problem, we propose NODDLE (integration of NOde2vec anD Deep Learning mEthod), a deep learning model which incorporates the features extracted by node2vec and feeds them into a four layer hidden neural network.
