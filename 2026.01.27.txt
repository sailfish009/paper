AUTHORS: Siyan Zhao; Zhihui Xie; Mengchen Liu; Jing Huang; Guan Pang; Feiyu Chen; Aditya Grover
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, on-policy distillation typically requires a separate, often larger, teacher LLM and does not explicitly leverage ground-truth solutions available in reasoning datasets. Inspired by the intuition that a sufficiently capable LLM can rationalize external privileged reasoning traces and teach its weaker self (i.e., the version without access to privileged information), we introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), a framework where a single model acts as both teacher and student by conditioning on different contexts.

AUTHORS: Fengting Zhang; Yue He; Qinghao Liu; Yaonan Wang; Xiang Chen; Hang Zhang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Deep learning has revolutionized medical image registration by achieving unprecedented speeds, yet its clinical application is hindered by a limited ability to generalize beyond the training domain, a critical weakness given the typically small scale of medical datasets. In this paper, we introduce FMIR, a foundation model-based registration framework that overcomes this limitation.Combining a foundation model-based feature encoder for extracting anatomical structures with a general registration head, and trained with a channel regularization strategy on just a single dataset, FMIR achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) in-domain performance while maintaining robust registration on out-of-domain images.Our approach demonstrates a viable path toward building generalizable medical imaging foundation models with limited resources.

AUTHORS: Hao Li; He Cao; Shenyao Peng; Zijing Liu; Bin Feng; Yu Wang; Zhiyuan Yan; Yonghong Tian; Yu Li; Li Yuan
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Yet current approaches struggle between small language models prone to hallucination and limited knowledge retention, and large cloud-based language models plagued by privacy risks and high inference costs. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChemCRAFT, a novel framework leveraging agentic reinforcement learning to decouple chemical reasoning from knowledge storage.

69, TITLE: LLMs As Cultural Archives: Cultural Commonsense Knowledge Graph Extraction

78, TITLE: Beyond A Single Perspective: Text Anomaly Detection with Multi-View Language Representations
AUTHORS: Yixin Liu; Kehan Yan; Shiyuan Li; Qingfeng Chen; Shirui Pan
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: While two-step "embedding-detector" TAD methods have shown state-of-the-art performance, their effectiveness is often limited by the use of a single embedding model and the lack of adaptability across diverse datasets and anomaly types. To address these limitations, we propose to exploit the embeddings from multiple pretrained language models and integrate them into $MCA^2$, a multi-view TAD framework.

79, TITLE: Benchmarking Direct Preference Optimization for Medical Large Vision-Language Models

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.SE [SE]
HIGHLIGHT: A central challenge in realizing effective agentic mid-training is the distribution mismatch between static training data and the dynamic, feedback-rich environment of real development. To address this, we present a systematic study of agentic mid-training, establishing both the data synthesis principles and training methodology for effective agent development at scale.

93, TITLE: Closing The Modality Gap Aligns Group-Wise Semantics
AUTHORS: Eleonora Grassucci; Giordano Cicchetti; Emanuele Frasca; Aurelio Uncini; Danilo Comminiello
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While the necessity of addressing this phenomenon remains debated, particularly given its limited impact on instance-wise tasks (e.g., retrieval), we prove that its influence is instead strongly pronounced in group-level tasks (e.g., clustering). To support this claim, we introduce a novel method designed to consistently reduce this discrepancy in two-modal settings, with a straightforward extension to the general $n$-modal case.

110, TITLE: UPLiFT: Efficient Pixel-Dense Feature Upsampling with Local Attenders
AUTHORS: Matthew Walmer; Saksham Suri; Anirud Aggarwal; Abhinav Shrivastava
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While early works in this space used iterative upsampling approaches, more recent works have switched to cross-attention-based methods, which risk falling into the same efficiency scaling problems of the backbones they are upsampling. In this work, we demonstrate that iterative upsampling methods can still compete with cross-attention-based methods; moreover, they can achieve state-of-the-art performance with lower inference costs.

113, TITLE: MulVul: Retrieval-augmented Multi-Agent Code Vulnerability Detection Via Cross-Model Prompt Evolution
AUTHORS: Zihan Wu; Jie Xu; Yun Peng; Chun Yong Chong; Xiaohua Jia
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.SE [SE]
HIGHLIGHT: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to automate real-world vulnerability detection due to two key limitations: the heterogeneity of vulnerability patterns undermines the effectiveness of a single unified model, and manual prompt engineering for massive weakness categories is unscalable. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MulVul}, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for precise and broad-coverage vulnerability detection.

114, TITLE: \textsc{NaVIDA}: Vision-Language Navigation with Inverse Dynamics Augmentation
AUTHORS: Weiye Zhu; Zekai Zhang; Xiangchen Wang; Hewei Pan; Teng Wang; Tiantian Geng; Rongtao Xu; Feng Zheng
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Lacking such vision-action causality, agents cannot anticipate the visual changes induced by its own actions, leading to unstable behaviors, weak generalization, and cumulative error along trajectory. To address these issues, we introduce \textsc{NaVIDA} (\textbf{Nav}igation with \textbf{I}nverse \textbf{D}ynamics \textbf{A}ugmentation), a unified VLN framework that couples policy learning with action-grounded visual dynamics and adaptive execution.

115, TITLE: Phase Transition for Budgeted Multi-Agent Synergy
AUTHORS: Bang Liu; Linglong Kong; Jian Pei
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Multi-agent systems can improve reliability, yet under a fixed inference budget they often help, saturate, or even collapse. We develop a minimal and calibratable theory that predicts these regimes from three binding constraints of modern agent stacks: finite context windows, lossy inter-agent communication, and shared failures among similar agents.

AUTHORS: Yanming Liu; Xinyue Peng; Zixuan Yan; Yanxin Shen; Wenjie Xu; Yuefeng Huang; Xinyi Wang; Jiannan Cao; Jianwei Yin; Xuhong Zhang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: This reliance on implicit reasoning creates fundamental challenges for managing dependencies between sub-questions, efficiently reusing previously retrieved knowledge, and learning optimal search strategies through reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we propose Dep-Search, a dependency-aware search framework that advances beyond existing search frameworks by integrating structured reasoning, retrieval, and persistent memory through GRPO.

117, TITLE: Robust Privacy: Inference-Time Privacy Through Certified Robustness
AUTHORS: Jiankai Jin; Xiangzheng Zhang; Zhao Liu; Deyue Zhang; Quanchen Zou
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce Robust Privacy (RP), an inference-time privacy notion inspired by certified robustness: if a model's prediction is provably invariant within a radius-$R$ neighborhood around an input $x$ (e.g., under the $\ell_2$ norm), then $x$ enjoys $R$-Robust Privacy, i.e., observing the prediction cannot distinguish $x$ from any input within distance $R$ of $x$.

AUTHORS: Lan Yang; Minghan Yang; Ke Li; Honggang Zhang; Kaiyue Pang; Yi-Zhe Song
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Yet, a persistent limitation remains: while reconstructed images often appear naturalistic and holistically similar to the target stimuli, they frequently suffer from severe semantic misalignment -- salient objects are often replaced or hallucinated despite high visual quality. In this work, we address this limitation by rethinking the role of explicit semantic interpretation in fMRI decoding.

125, TITLE: Emergence of Phonemic, Syntactic, and Semantic Representations in Artificial Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Pierre Orhan; Pablo Diego-Simón; Emmnanuel Chemla; Yair Lakretz; Yves Boubenec; Jean-Rémi King

AUTHORS: Zhenyuan Guo; Tong Chen; Wenlong Meng; Chen Gong; Xin Yu; Chengkun Wei; Wenzhi Chen
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This work uses attention maps to analyze the influence of reasoning traces and uncover an interesting phenomenon: only some decision-critical tokens in a reasoning trace steer the model toward the final answer, while the remaining tokens contribute negligibly. Building on this observation, we propose Dynamic Thinking-Token Selection (DynTS).

AUTHORS: Wenhao Zou; Yuwei Miao; Zhanyu Ma; Jun Xu; Jiuchong Gao; Jinghua Hao; Renqing He; Jingwen Xu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.SD [SD]
HIGHLIGHT: Since cascaded architectures remain the dominant choice for complex tasks, existing cascaded streaming strategies attempt to reduce this latency via mechanical segmentation (e.g., fixed chunks, VAD-based splitting) or speculative generation, but they frequently either break semantic units or waste computation on predictions that must be rolled back. To address these challenges, we propose LTS-VoiceAgent, a Listen-Think-Speak framework that explicitly separates when to think from how to reason incrementally.

AUTHORS: Can Liu; Jaeuk Lee; Tianhe Chen; Zhibang Jiang; Xiaolin Wen; Yong Wang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.HC [HC]
HIGHLIGHT: However, it is often challenging to implement interactions for existing static visualizations, since the underlying code and data for existing static visualizations are often not available, and it also takes significant time and effort to enable interactions for them even if the original code and data are available. To fill this gap, we propose Athanor, a novel approach to transform existing static visualizations into interactive ones using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and natural language instructions.

212, TITLE: Success Conditioning As Policy Improvement: The Optimization Problem Solved By Imitating Success
AUTHORS: Daniel Russo
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Exact success conditioning cannot degrade performance or induce dangerous distribution shift, but when it fails, it does so observably, by hardly changing the policy at all. We apply our theory to the common practice of return thresholding, showing this can amplify improvement, but at the cost of potential misalignment with the true objective.

213, TITLE: Fluxamba: Topology-Aware Anisotropic State Space Models for Geological Lineament Segmentation in Multi-Source Remote Sensing
AUTHORS: Jin Bai; Huiyao Zhang; Qi Wen; Shengyang Li; Xiaolin Tian; Atta ur Rahman

HIGHLIGHT: Although State Space Models (SSMs) offer near-linear computational complexity, their dependence on rigid, axis-aligned scanning trajectories induces a fundamental topological mismatch with curvilinear targets, resulting in fragmented context and feature erosion. To bridge this gap, we propose Fluxamba, a lightweight architecture that introduces a topology-aware feature rectification framework.

214, TITLE: Elastic Attention: Test-time Adaptive Sparsity Ratios for Efficient Transformers
AUTHORS: Zecheng Tang; Quantong Qiu; Yi Yang; Zhiyi Hong; Haiya Xiang; Kebin Liu; Qingqing Dang; Juntao Li; Min Zhang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: While hybrid attention strategies that combine sparse and full attention within a single model offer a viable solution, they typically employ static computation ratios (i.e., fixed proportions of sparse versus full attention) and fail to adapt to the varying sparsity sensitivities of downstream tasks during inference. To address this issue, we propose Elastic Attention, which allows the model to dynamically adjust its overall sparsity based on the input.

HIGHLIGHT: Unified remote sensing multimodal models exhibit a pronounced spatial reversal curse: Although they can accurately recognize and describe object locations in images, they often fail to faithfully execute the same spatial relations during text-to-image generation, where such relations constitute core semantic information in remote sensing. Motivated by this observation, we propose Uni-RS, the first unified multimodal model tailored for remote sensing, to explicitly address the spatial asymmetry between understanding and generation.

AUTHORS: Byeonggyeol Choi; Woojin Oh; Jongwoo Lim
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.RO [RO]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing resources such as DexYCB and HO3D are primarily optimized for visual alignment but often yield physically implausible interactions when replayed in physics simulators, including penetration, missed contact, and unstable grasps. We propose a simulation-in-the-loop refinement framework that converts these visually aligned trajectories into physically executable ones.

To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight domain generalization framework with quantum-enhanced collaborative learning, enabling robust generalization to unseen target domains without relying on real multi-center labeled data.

280, TITLE: REMAC: Reference-Based Martian Asymmetrical Image Compression
AUTHORS: Qing Ding; Mai Xu; Shengxi Li; Xin Deng; Xin Zou
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Motivated by our empirical analysis of the strong \textit{intra-} and \textit{inter-image} similarities from the perspective of texture, color, and semantics, we propose a reference-based Martian asymmetrical image compression (REMAC) approach, which shifts computational complexity from the encoder to the resource-rich decoder and simultaneously improves compression performance.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Moreover, prompt-based methods often exhibit excessive dependency on expert-crafted knowledge without autonomous pattern-learning capacity. To address these limitations, we view personality detection as a ranking task rather than a classification and propose a corresponding reinforcement learning training paradigm.

283, TITLE: Dynamic Role Assignment for Multi-Agent Debate
AUTHORS: Miao Zhang; Junsik Kim; Siyuan Xiang; Jian Gao; Cheng Cao
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose dynamic role assignment, a framework that runs a Meta-Debate to select suitable agents before the actual debate.

284, TITLE: MEGnifying Emotion: Sentiment Analysis from Annotated Brain Data
AUTHORS: Brian Liu; Oiwi Parker Jones
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.HC [HC]
HIGHLIGHT: While a number of existing datasets align brain data with speech and with speech transcripts, no datasets have annotated brain data with sentiment. To bridge this gap, we explore the use of pre-trained Text-to-Sentiment models to annotate non invasive brain recordings, acquired using magnetoencephalography (MEG), while participants listened to audiobooks.

285, TITLE: Multi-Perspective Subimage CLIP with Keyword Guidance for Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval
AUTHORS: Yifan Li; Shiying Wang; Jianqiang Huang

AUTHORS: Saurabh Jha; Rohan Arora; Noah Zheutlin; Paulina Toro Isaza; Laura Shwartz; Yu Deng; Daby Sow; Ruchi Mahindru; Ruchir Puri
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In addition, ReAct entangles semantic reasoning with controller duties such as tool orchestration and state tracking, so execution errors and plan drift degrade reasoning while consuming scarce context. We address these issues by formulating investigation as abductive reasoning over a dependency graph and proposing EoG (Explanations over Graphs), a disaggregated framework in which an LLM performs bounded local evidence mining and labeling (cause vs symptom) while a deterministic controller manages traversal, state, and belief propagation to compute a minimal explanatory frontier.

HIGHLIGHT: However, there is much improvement room on restoring 3D scenes based on NeRF from corrupted images, which are common in natural scene captures and can significantly impact the effectiveness of NeRF. This paper introduces NeRF-MIR, a novel neural rendering approach specifically proposed for the restoration of masked images, demonstrating the potential of NeRF in this domain.

292, TITLE: FineVAU: A Novel Human-Aligned Benchmark for Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Understanding
AUTHORS: João Pereira; Vasco Lopes; João Neves; David Semedo
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The first fails to capture the rich, free-form, and visually grounded nature of LVLM responses, while the latter focuses on assessing language quality over factual relevance, often resulting in subjective judgments that are misaligned with human perception. In this work, we address this issue by proposing FineVAU, a new benchmark for VAU that shifts the focus towards rich, fine-grained and domain-specific understanding of anomalous videos.

294, TITLE: Decoding Psychological States Through Movement: Inferring Human Kinesic Functions with Application to Built Environments
AUTHORS: Cheyu Lin; Katherine A. Flanigan; Sirajum Munir
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Yet in civil and built-environment research, there is no consistent and privacy-preserving way to represent and measure socially meaningful interaction in these spaces, leaving studies to operationalize "interaction" differently across contexts and limiting practitioners' ability to evaluate whether design interventions are changing the forms of interaction that social capital theory predicts should matter. To address this field-level and methodological gap, we introduce the Dyadic User Engagement DataseT (DUET) dataset and an embedded kinesics recognition framework that operationalize Ekman and Friesen's kinesics taxonomy as a function-level interaction vocabulary aligned with social capital-relevant behaviors (e.g., reciprocity and attention coordination).

AUTHORS: Keigo Shibata; Kazuki Yano; Ryosuke Takahashi; Jaesung Lee; Wataru Ikeda; Jun Suzuki
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: To characterize this, we first introduce a quantitative metric for the jump strength around the final layer, and then demonstrate its prevalence across many open-weight models, as well as its amplification throughout pre-training. Assuming such jumps indicate an undesirable property, we propose the jump-suppressing regularizer (JREG) which penalizes this jump during pre-training, thereby encouraging more balanced capability usage across the middle layers.

300, TITLE: Grounded Concreteness: Human-Like Concreteness Sensitivity in Vision-Language Models
AUTHORS: Aryan Roy; Zekun Wang; Christopher J. MacLellan

AUTHORS: Yuhang Jia; Pei Liu; Haoqin Sun; Jiaming Zhou; Xuxin Cheng; Cao Liu; Ke Zeng; Xunliang Cai; Yong Qin
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CL [CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Such reliance is fundamentally limited for modeling complex empathy, as there is no single "correct" response and a simple numerical score cannot fully capture the nuances of emotional expression or the appropriateness of empathetic behavior. To address these limitations, we sequentially introduce EmpathyEval, a descriptive natural-language-based evaluation model for assessing empathetic quality in spoken dialogues.

497, TITLE: Credit Fairness: Online Fairness In Shared Resource Pools
AUTHORS: Seyed Majid Zahedi; Rupert Freeman
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.GT [GT]
HIGHLIGHT: However, recent work (Vuppalapati et al. 2023) has shown that this max-min mechanism can lead to large disparities in the total resources received by agents, even when they have the same average demand. In this paper, we introduce credit fairness, a strengthening of sharing incentives that ensures agents who lend resources in early rounds are able to recoup them in later rounds.
