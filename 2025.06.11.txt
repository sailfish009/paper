CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, such adaptation frequently suppresses motion dynamics of generated outputs, resulting in more static videos compared to their T2V counterparts. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and identify that it stems from the premature exposure to high-frequency details in the input image, which biases the sampling process toward a shortcut trajectory that overfits to the static appearance of the reference image.

To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight post-training framework that refines latent reasoning trajectories using two novel strategies: 1) Contrastive reasoning feedback, which compares reasoning embeddings against strong and weak baselines to infer effective update directions via embedding enhancement; 2) Residual embedding refinement, which stabilizes updates by progressively integrating current and historical gradients, enabling fast yet controlled convergence.

306, TITLE: Efficient Fireworks Algorithm Equipped with An Explosion Mechanism Based on Student's T-distribution
AUTHORS: Cen Shipeng ; Tan Ying
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: This work of ours proposes a new student's t-distribution based FWA(TFWA) with a solid theoretical foundation, which fully utilizes the advantage that student's t-distribution can adjust the parameters (degrees of freedom) and thus adjust the exploitation capability.

AUTHORS: Parosh Abdulla ; Elli Anastasiadi ; Mohamed Faouzi Atig ; Samuel Grahn
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: The more general verification problem, i.e., checking whether all allowed program runs are consistent with a memory model, has still not been studied as much. The purpose of this work is to bridge this gap.

312, TITLE: Worst-Case Symbolic Constraints Analysis and Generalisation with Large Language Models
AUTHORS: Daniel Koh ; Yannic Noller ; Corina S. Pasareanu ; Adrians Skapars ; Youcheng Sun
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Specifically, we define and address the problem of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis as a measure to assess the comprehension of LLMs.

313, TITLE: On The Impact of Merge Request Deviations on Code Review Practices
AUTHORS: Samah Kansab ; Francis Bordeleau ; Ali Tizghadam
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We identify seven deviation categories, occurring in 37.02% of MRs, and propose a few-shot learning detection method (91% accuracy).

314, TITLE: SPBA: Utilizing Speech Large Language Model for Backdoor Attacks on Speech Classification Models
AUTHORS: WENHAN YAO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, cs.CL, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose that speech backdoor attacks can strategically focus on speech elements such as timbre and emotion, leveraging the Speech Large Language Model (SLLM) to generate diverse triggers.

315, TITLE: Support Bound for Differential Elimination in Polynomial Dynamical Systems
AUTHORS: Yulia Mukhina ; Gleb Pogudin
CATEGORY: cs.SC [cs.SC, math.AG, math.CA]
HIGHLIGHT: The main contribution of the present paper is a generalization of the aforementioned result in two directions: to allow any polynomial function $y = f(\mathbf{x})$, not just a single coordinate, and to allow $\mathbf{g}$ and $f$ depend on unknown symbolic parameters.

316, TITLE: Approaching Dialogue State Tracking Via Aligning Speech Encoders and LLMs
AUTHORS: ?IMON SEDL�?EK et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we approach spoken Dialogue State Tracking (DST) by bridging the representation spaces of speech encoders and LLMs via a small connector module, with a focus on fully open-sourced and open-data components (WavLM-large, OLMo).

317, TITLE: A System for Accurate Tracking and Video Recordings of Rodent Eye Movements Using Convolutional Neural Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: Isha Puri ; David Cox
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Research in neuroscience and vision science relies heavily on careful measurements of animal subject's gaze direction. Rodents are the most widely studied animal subjects for such research because of their economic advantage and hardiness.
