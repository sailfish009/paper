37, TITLE: On The Proper Treatment of Tokenization in Psycholinguistics
AUTHORS: MARIO GIULIANELLI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: The paper argues that token-level language models should be (approximately) marginalized into character-level language models before they are used in psycholinguistic studies to compute the surprisal of a region of interest; then, the marginalized character-level language model can be used to compute the surprisal of an arbitrary character substring, which we term a focal area, that the experimenter may wish to use as a predictor. Our proposal of marginalizing a token-level model into a character-level one solves this misalignment issue independently of the tokenization scheme.

AUTHORS: Ga?per Podobnik ; Toma? Vrtovec

HIGHLIGHT: To quantitatively evaluate the alignment of two segmentations, researchers commonly resort to counting metrics, such as the Dice similarity coefficient, or distance-based metrics, such as the Hausdorff distance, which are usually computed by publicly available open-source tools with an inherent assumption that these tools provide consistent results. In this study we questioned this assumption, and performed a systematic implementation analysis along with quantitative experiments on real-world clinical data to compare 11 open-source tools for distance-based metrics computation against our highly accurate mesh-based reference implementation.
