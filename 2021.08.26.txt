AUTHORS:	Frauke Wilm ; Katharina Breininger ; Marc Aubreville
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	This work presents a mitotic figure detection algorithm developed as a 
baseline for the challenge, based on domain adversarial training.

81, TITLE:	Measurement of Hybrid Rocket Solid Fuel Regression Rate for A Slab Burner Using Deep Learning
AUTHORS:	Gabriel Surina III ; Georgios Georgalis ; Siddhant S. Aphale ; Abani Patra ; Paul E. DesJardin
CATEGORY:	eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	This study presents an imaging-based deep learning tool to measure the 
fuel regression rate in a 2D slab burner experiment for hybrid rocket 
fuels.

82, TITLE:	Cell Multi-Bernoulli (Cell-MB) Sensor Control for Multi-object Search-While-Tracking (SWT)
AUTHORS:	Keith A. LeGrand ; Pingping Zhu ; Silvia Ferrari
CATEGORY:	eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT:
	Unlike existing RFS approaches, the approximation presented in this 
paper accounts for noisy measurements, missed detections, false alarms, 
and object appearance/disappearance.
