27, TITLE: Foundation Policies with Hilbert Representations
AUTHORS: Seohong Park ; Tobias Kreiman ; Sergey Levine
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: While a number of methods have been proposed to enable generic self-supervised RL, based on principles such as goal-conditioned RL, behavioral cloning, and unsupervised skill learning, such methods remain limited in terms of either the diversity of the discovered behaviors, the need for high-quality demonstration data, or the lack of a clear prompting or adaptation mechanism for downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised framework to pre-train generalist policies that capture diverse, optimal, long-horizon behaviors from unlabeled offline data such that they can be quickly adapted to any arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner.

247, TITLE: A Generative Machine Learning Model for Material Microstructure 3D Reconstruction and Performance Evaluation
AUTHORS: Yilin Zheng ; Zhigong Song
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: The reconstruction of 3D microstructures from 2D slices is considered to hold significant value in predicting the spatial structure and physical properties of materials.The dimensional extension from 2D to 3D is viewed as a highly challenging inverse problem from the current technological perspective.Recently,methods based on generative adversarial networks have garnered widespread attention.However,they are still hampered by numerous limitations,including oversimplified models,a requirement for a substantial number of training samples,and difficulties in achieving model convergence during training.In light of this,a novel generative model that integrates the multiscale properties of U-net with and the generative capabilities of GAN has been proposed.Based on this,the innovative construction of a multi-scale channel aggregation module,a multi-scale hierarchical feature aggregation module and a convolutional block attention mechanism can better capture the properties of the material microstructure and extract the image information.The model's accuracy is further improved by combining the image regularization loss with the Wasserstein distance loss.In addition,this study utilizes the anisotropy index to accurately distinguish the nature of the image,which can clearly determine the isotropy and anisotropy of the image.It is also the first time that the generation quality of material samples from different domains is evaluated and the performance of the model itself is compared.The experimental results demonstrate that the present model not only shows a very high similarity between the generated 3D structures and real samples but is also highly consistent with real data in terms of statistical data analysis.
