HIGHLIGHT: However, as a non-end-to-end training method, indicating the meta-training stage can only begin after the completion of pre-training, Meta-Baseline suffers from higher training cost and suboptimal performance due to the inherent conflicts of the two training stages. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end training paradigm consisting of two alternative loops.
