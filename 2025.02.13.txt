This paper presents a first step towards this direction.

AUTHORS: Christopher van Le

159, TITLE: Top-Theta Attention: Sparsifying Transformers By Compensated Thresholding
AUTHORS: Konstantin Berestizshevsky ; Renzo Andri ; Lukas Cavigelli
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, 68T01, I.2]

We introduce a novel approach called Top-Theta Attention, or simply Top-$\theta$, which selectively prunes less essential attention elements by comparing them against carefully calibrated thresholds.

168, TITLE: Learning in Markets with Heterogeneous Agents: Dynamics and Survival of Bayesian Vs. No-Regret Learners
AUTHORS: David Easley ; Yoav Kolumbus ; Eva Tardos
CATEGORY: cs.GT [cs.GT, cs.AI, cs.MA, econ.TH]
HIGHLIGHT: Any no-regret learner will drive out of the market an imperfect Bayesian whose finite prior or update rule has even small errors. We formally establish the relationship between notions of survival, vanishing, and market domination studied in economics and the framework of regret minimization, thus bridging these theories.

AUTHORS: Kristofer Grover Roos ; Quan Huu Cap ; Atsushi Fukuda
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In contrast, electroencephalography (EEG) provides millisecond-level precision in capturing electrical activity but lacks the spatial resolution necessary for precise neural localization. To bridge these gaps, we introduce E2fNet, a simple yet effective deep learning model for synthesizing fMRI images from low-cost EEG data.

AUTHORS: Yoshiyuki Ohmura ; Wataru Shimaya ; Yasuo Kuniyoshi
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.NE]

178, TITLE: Rhythmic Sharing: A Bio-inspired Paradigm for Zero-shot Adaptation and Learning in Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Hoony Kang ; Wolfgang Losert
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, math.DS, nlin.AO, physics.bio-ph]

We apply the graph rewriting framework to fixed point operators as well as the operational semantics from the first part, and present a new hardware description language based on these theoretical developments.
