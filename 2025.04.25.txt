HIGHLIGHT: Traditionally, a raster-scan order (from top-left to bottom-right) guides autoregressive image generation models. In this paper, we argue that this order is suboptimal, as it fails to respect the causality of the image content: for instance, when conditioned on a visual description of a sunset, an autoregressive model may generate clouds before the sun, even though the color of clouds should depend on the color of the sun and not the inverse.

AUTHORS: YU HONG et. al.

Motivated by this, we propose a novel $\textit{GTF}$ for text-guided semantic manipulation, which has the following attractive capabilities: 1) $\textbf{Generalized}$: our $\textit{GTF}$ supports multiple semantic manipulations (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) and can be seamlessly integrated into all diffusion-based methods (i.e., Plug-and-play) across different modalities (i.e., modality-agnostic); and 2) $\textbf{Training-free}$: $\textit{GTF}$ produces high-fidelity results via simply controlling the geometric relationship between noises without tuning or optimization.

181, TITLE: Revisiting Reset Mechanisms in Spiking Neural Networks for Sequential Modeling: Specialized Discretization for Binary Activated RNN
AUTHORS: Enqi Zhang
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This article focuses on an another alternative perspective,viewing SNNs as binary-activated recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential modeling tasks.From this viewpoint, current SNN architectures face several fundamental challenges in sequence modeling: (1) Traditional models lack effective memory mechanisms for long-range sequence modeling; (2) The biological-inspired components in SNNs (such as reset mechanisms and refractory period applications) remain theoretically under-explored for sequence tasks; (3) The RNN-like computational paradigm in SNNs prevents parallel training across different timesteps.To address these challenges, this study conducts a systematic analysis of the fundamental mechanisms underlying reset operations and refractory periods in binary-activated RNN-based SNN sequence models. We re-examine whether such biological mechanisms are strictly necessary for generating sparse spiking patterns, provide new theoretical explanations and insights, and ultimately propose the fixed-refractory-period SNN architecture for sequence modeling.
