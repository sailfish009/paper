246, TITLE: Contrastive Deep Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Community Detection
AUTHORS: Yuecheng Li ; Jialong Chen ; Chuan Chen ; Lei Yang ; Zibin Zheng
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.SI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the existing NMF-based methods have the following three problems: 1) they directly transform the original network into community membership space, so it is difficult for them to capture the hierarchical information; 2) they often only pay attention to the topology of the network and ignore its node attributes; 3) it is hard for them to learn the global structure information necessary for community detection. Therefore, we propose a new community detection algorithm, named Contrastive Deep Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CDNMF).
