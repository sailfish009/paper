HIGHLIGHT: Since the practical applications of oracle models are limited due to their assumptions, we introduce a composite multi-task training objective involving separation and classification losses.

233, TITLE: QSMDiff: Unsupervised 3D Diffusion Models for Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping
AUTHORS: Zhuang Xiong ; Wei Jiang ; Yang Gao ; Feng Liu ; Hongfu Sun
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we developed a 3D image patch-based diffusion model, namely QSMDiff, for robust QSM reconstruction across different scan parameters, alongside simultaneous super-resolution and image-denoising tasks.

234, TITLE: LeFusion: Synthesizing Myocardial Pathology on Cardiac MRI Via Lesion-Focus Diffusion Models
AUTHORS: Hantao Zhang ; Jiancheng Yang ; Shouhong Wan ; Pascal Fua
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Inspired by diffusion-based image inpainting, we propose LeFusion, lesion-focused diffusion models.

235, TITLE: ResNet101 and DAE for Enhance Quality and Classification Accuracy in Skin Cancer Imaging
AUTHORS: Sibasish Dhibar
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, 68U10, 94A08, J.3; I.4.3; I.4.9]
HIGHLIGHT: To overcome the existing issues, we introduce an innovative convolutional ensemble network approach named deep autoencoder (DAE) with ResNet101.

236, TITLE: CathFlow: Self-Supervised Segmentation of Catheters in Interventional Ultrasound Using Optical Flow and Transformers
AUTHORS: Alex Ranne ; Liming Kuang ; Yordanka Velikova ; Nassir Navab ; Ferdinando Rodriguez y Baena
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we seek to address both problems by introducing a self-supervised deep learning architecture to segment catheters in longitudinal ultrasound images, without demanding any labeled data.
