AUTHORS: LIN LI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Nearly all existing scene graph generation (SGG) models have overlooked the ground-truth annotation qualities of mainstream SGG datasets, i.e., they assume: 1) all the manually annotated positive samples are equally correct; 2) all the un-annotated negative samples are absolutely background. In this paper, we argue that neither of the assumptions applies to SGG: there are numerous noisy ground-truth predicate labels that break these two assumptions and harm the training of unbiased SGG models.
