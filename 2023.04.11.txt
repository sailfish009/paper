AUTHORS: Yilong Yang ; Srinandan Dasmahapatra ; Sasan Mahmoodi
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: When conventional CNNs are applied to histopathology image analysis, the generalization performance of models is limited because 1) a part of the parameters of filters are trained to fit rotation transformation, thus decreasing the capability of learning other discriminative features; 2) fixed-size filters trained on images at a given scale fail to generalize to those at different scales.
