AUTHORS: Manon Flageat ; Bryan Lim ; Antoine Cully
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We highlight that existing procedures that only use the expected return are limited on two fronts: first an infinite number of return distributions with a wide range of performance-reproducibility trade-offs can have the same expected return, limiting its effectiveness when used for comparing policies; second, the expected return metric does not leave any room for practitioners to choose the best trade-off value for considered applications. In this work, we address these limitations by recommending the use of Lower Confidence Bound, a metric taken from Bayesian optimisation that provides the user with a preference parameter to choose a desired performance-reproducibility trade-off.

AUTHORS: Son The Nguyen ; Theja Tulabandhula ; Mary Beth Watson-Manheim
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.HC]
HIGHLIGHT: One of the key shortcomings of these discriminative AI tools that have been already deployed is that they are not adaptable and user-friendly compared to generative AI tools (e.g., GPT4, Stable Diffusion, Bard, etc.), where a non-expert user can iteratively refine model inputs and give real-time feedback that can be accounted for immediately, allowing users to build trust from the start. Inspired by this emerging collaborative workflow, we develop a new system architecture that enables users to work with discriminative models (such as for object detection, sentiment classification, etc.) in a fashion similar to generative AI tools, where they can easily provide immediate feedback as well as adapt the deployed models as desired.
