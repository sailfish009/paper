AUTHORS: Nicholas Konz ; Maciej A. Mazurowski

Analyzing eleven natural and medical image datasets across six network architectures, we find that the shape of this ID evolution curve differs noticeably between natural and medical image models: medical image models peak in representation ID earlier in the network, implying a difference in the image features and their abstractness that are typically used for downstream tasks in these domains.

To address these problems, we introduce a novel architecture, namely the Large Language Model-based Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LLM-PCGC) method, using LLM to compress point cloud geometry information without any text description or aligning operation.
