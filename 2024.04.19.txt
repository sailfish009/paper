AUTHORS: Xenia Ohmer ; Elia Bruni ; Dieuwke Hupkes
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This is especially true since many LLMs are exclusively trained on text, casting doubt on whether their stellar benchmark performances are reflective of a true understanding of the problems represented by these benchmarks, or whether LLMs simply excel at uttering textual forms that correlate with what someone who understands the problem would say. In this philosophically inspired work, we aim to create some separation between form and meaning, with a series of tests that leverage the idea that world understanding should be consistent across presentational modes - inspired by Fregean senses - of the same meaning.

Based on these insights, we propose a novel method to mitigate this bias by imposing penalties on the magnitude of the principal singular value.

129, TITLE: Warped Time Series Anomaly Detection
AUTHORS: Charlotte Lacoquelle ; Xavier Pucel ; Louise Trav�-Massuy�s ; Axel Reymonet ; Beno�t Enaux
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper addresses the problem of detecting time series outliers, focusing on systems with repetitive behavior, such as industrial robots operating on production lines.Notable challenges arise from the fact that a task performed multiple times may exhibit different duration in each repetition and that the time series reported by the sensors are irregularly sampled because of data gaps. The anomaly detection approach presented in this paper consists of three stages.The first stage identifies the repetitive cycles in the lengthy time series and segments them into individual time series corresponding to one task cycle, while accounting for possible temporal distortions.The second stage computes a prototype for the cycles using a GPU-based barycenter algorithm, specifically tailored for very large time series.The third stage uses the prototype to detect abnormal cycles by computing an anomaly score for each cycle.The overall approach, named WarpEd Time Series ANomaly Detection (WETSAND), makes use of the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm and its variants because they are suited to the distorted nature of the time series.The experiments show that \wetsand scales to large signals, computes human-friendly prototypes, works with very little data, and outperforms some general purpose anomaly detection approaches such as autoencoders.

AUTHORS: HYUHNG JOON KIM et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: However, conversational agents built upon even the most recent large language models (LLMs) face challenges in processing ambiguous inputs, primarily due to the following two hurdles: (1) LLMs are not directly trained to handle inputs that are too ambiguous to be properly managed; (2) the degree of ambiguity in an input can vary according to the intrinsic knowledge of the LLMs, which is difficult to investigate. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method to align LLMs to explicitly handle ambiguous inputs.
