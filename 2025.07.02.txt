AUTHORS: HUAQIU LI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Unified image restoration is a significantly challenging task in low-levelvision. Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks,limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely ontraining with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints.To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approachthrough recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusionmodel.

In this paper, we address this question through a series oflarge-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30models ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs.

240, TITLE: Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network with Sinusoidal Encoding for Robust Human Action Segmentation
AUTHORS: Hao Xing ; Kai Zhe Boey ; Yuankai Wu ; Darius Burschka ; Gordon Cheng
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: However, the inherent noisein both human pose estimation and object detection often leads toover-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. Toaddress this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) thatintegrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g.,30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation.Our framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encodingstrategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space toenhance spatial representation robustness.
