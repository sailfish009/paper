91, TITLE: Beyond Imitation: Learning Key Reasoning Steps from Dual Chain-of-Thoughts in Reasoning Distillation
AUTHORS: Chengwei Dai ; Kun Li ; Wei Zhou ; Songlin Hu
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, previous distillation methods typically involve supervised fine-tuning student SLMs only on correct CoTs data produced by teacher LLMs, resulting in students struggling to learn the key reasoning steps, instead imitating the teacher's reasoning forms and making errors or omissions on these steps. To address these issues, drawing an analogy to human learning, where analyzing mistakes according to correct solutions often reveals the crucial steps leading to successes or failures, we propose mistak\textbf{E}-\textbf{D}riven key reason\textbf{I}ng step distilla\textbf{T}ion (\textbf{EDIT}), a novel method that further aids SLMs learning key reasoning steps rather than mere simple fine-tuning.

117, TITLE: Group Robust Preference Optimization in Reward-free RLHF
AUTHORS: SHYAM SUNDHAR RAMESH et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While these data often come from diverse labelers' groups (e.g., different demographics, ethnicities, company teams, etc.), traditional RLHF approaches adopt a "one-size-fits-all" approach, i.e., they indiscriminately assume and optimize a single preference model, thus not being robust to unique characteristics and needs of the various groups. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Group Robust Preference Optimization (GRPO) method to align LLMs to individual groups' preferences robustly.

HIGHLIGHT: However, while we find that LLMs excel at identifying initial edit operations, they often fail to infer complete editing programs, and produce outputs that violate shape semantics. To overcome this issue, we introduce Analytical Edit Propagation (AEP), an algorithm which extends a seed edit with additional operations until a complete editing program has been formed.

127, TITLE: MotionLLM: Understanding Human Behaviors from Human Motions and Videos
AUTHORS: LING-HAO CHEN et. al.

To consider this property cleverly, we propose novel convolution operators, termed Twin Deformable point Convolutions (TDConvs), which aim to achieve adaptive feature learning by learning deformable sampling points in the latitude-longitude plane and altitude direction, respectively.
