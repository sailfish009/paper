AUTHORS: Fabian Denoodt ; Bart de Boer ; Jos� Oramas

156, TITLE: RIFF: Inducing Rules for Fraud Detection from Decision Trees
AUTHORS: Jo�o Lucas Martins ; Jo�o Bravo ; Ana Sofia Gomes ; Carlos Soares ; Pedro Bizarro
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, rule systems require significant input from domain experts to create and tune, an issue that rule induction algorithms attempt to mitigate by inferring rules directly from data. We explore the application of these algorithms to fraud detection, where rule systems are constrained to have a low false positive rate (FPR) or alert rate, by proposing RIFF, a rule induction algorithm that distills a low FPR rule set directly from decision trees.

157, TITLE: Accelerating The K-means++ Algorithm By Using Geometric Information
AUTHORS: Guillem Rodr�guez Corominas ; Maria J. Blesa ; Christian Blum
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, 91C20]

158, TITLE: Semi-Supervised Variational Adversarial Active Learning Via Learning to Rank and Agreement-Based Pseudo Labeling
AUTHORS: Zongyao Lyu ; William J. Beksi
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, VAAL has the following shortcomings: (i) it does not exploit target task information, and (ii) unlabeled data is only used for sample selection rather than model training. To address these limitations, we introduce novel techniques that significantly improve the use of abundant unlabeled data during training and take into account the task information.

162, TITLE: Assessing Modality Bias in Video Question Answering Benchmarks with Multimodal Large Language Models
AUTHORS: JEAN PARK et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing video question-answering (VidQA) benchmarks and datasets often exhibit a bias toward a single modality, despite the goal of requiring advanced reasoning skills that integrate diverse modalities to answer the queries. In this work, we introduce the modality importance score (MIS) to identify such bias.
