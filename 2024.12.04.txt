235, TITLE: Benchmarking Symbolic Regression Constant Optimization Schemes

236, TITLE: Learning Ensembles of Vision-based Safety Control Filters
AUTHORS: Ihab Tabbara ; Hussein Sibai
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.RO, cs.SY, eess.SY]
HIGHLIGHT: However, formally verifying that the learned filters satisfy critical properties that enable them to guarantee the safety of the system is currently beyond reach. Instead, in this work, motivated by the success of ensemble methods in reinforcement learning, we empirically investigate the efficacy of ensembles in enhancing the accuracy and the out-of-distribution generalization of such filters, as a step towards more reliable ones.

242, TITLE: Reproduction of AdEx Dynamics on Neuromorphic Hardware Through Data Embedding and Simulation-based Inference
AUTHORS: Jakob Huhle ; Jakob Kaiser ; Eric M�ller ; Johannes Schemmel
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we use an autoencoder to automatically extract relevant features from the membrane trace of a complex neuron model emulated on the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic system, and subsequently leverage sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE), a simulation-based inference algorithm, to approximate the posterior distribution of neuron parameters.

243, TITLE: Efficient, Portable, Census-Polymorphic Choreographic Programming
AUTHORS: MAKO BATES et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: Library-level CP implementations, like HasChor, integrate well with mainstream programming languages but have several limitations: Their conditionals require extra communication; they require specific host-language features (e.g., monads); and they lack support for programming patterns that are essential for implementing realistic distributed applications. We make three contributions to library-level CP to specifically address these challenges.

AUTHORS: Mehmet Arda Eren ; Erhan Oztop
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we develop a novel AL framework geared towards robotics regression tasks, such as action-effect prediction and, more generally, for world model learning, which we call MUSEL - Model Uncertainty for Sample Efficient Learning.
