To address this issue, we introduce the concept of Mechanistic Localization in text-to-image models, where knowledge about various visual attributes (e.g., ``style", ``objects", ``facts") can be mechanistically localized to a small fraction of layers in the UNet, thus facilitating efficient model editing.

AUTHORS: Hiroki Waida ; Kimihiro Yamazaki ; Atsushi Tokuhisa ; Mutsuyo Wada ; Yuichiro Wada
CATEGORY: stat.ML [stat.ML, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.IV, math.ST, stat.TH]
HIGHLIGHT: To provide better understanding of the approach, in this paper, we analyze a self-supervised denoising algorithm that uses denatured data in depth through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.
