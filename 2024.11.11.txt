AUTHORS: Nicole Meister ; Carlos Guestrin ; Tatsunori Hashimoto
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This notion of distributional alignment is complex, as there is significant variation in the types of attributes that are simulated. Prior works have underexplored the role of three critical variables -- the question domain, steering method, and distribution expression method -- which motivates our contribution of a benchmark explicitly addressing these dimensions.

4, TITLE: CodeLutra: Boosting LLM Code Generation Via Preference-Guided Refinement
AUTHORS: LEITIAN TAO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Fine-tuning smaller, open-source LLMs presents a viable alternative; however, it typically lags behind cutting-edge models due to supervised fine-tuning's reliance solely on correct code examples, which restricts the model's ability to learn from its own mistakes and adapt to diverse programming challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce CodeLutra, a novel framework that enhances low-performing LLMs by leveraging both successful and failed code generation attempts.

5, TITLE: WorkflowLLM: Enhancing Workflow Orchestration Capability of Large Language Models

AUTHORS: Joey Hong ; Anca Dragan ; Sergey Levine
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: This setting requires effectively leveraging pretraining, scaling to large architectures with billions of parameters, and training on large datasets, all of which represent major challenges for current value-based RL methods. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL algorithm that addresses these drawbacks, casting Q-learning as a modified supervised fine-tuning (SFT) problem where the probabilities of tokens directly translate to Q-values.

14, TITLE: Interactive Dialogue Agents Via Reinforcement Learning on Hindsight Regenerations
AUTHORS: Joey Hong ; Jessica Lin ; Anca Dragan ; Sergey Levine

Our key insight is that while LLMs may not be adept at identifying effective strategies for steering conversations a priori, or in the middle of an ongoing conversation, they can do so post-hoc, or in hindsight, after seeing how their conversational partner responds.
