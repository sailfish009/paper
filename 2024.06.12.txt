AUTHORS: Auguste Poiroux ; Gail Weiss ; Viktor Kun?ak ; Antoine Bosselut
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]

In this work, we propose a method to fix this issue through decoding with type-check filtering, where we initially sample a diverse set of candidate formalizations for an informal statement, then use the Lean proof assistant to filter out candidates that do not type-check.

AUTHORS: Yimeng Gu ; Mengqi Zhang ; Ignacio Castro ; Shu Wu ; Gareth Tyson
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.MM]

In this study, we propose an inference trajectory optimization framework based on the preference data extracted from decision trees to address this limitation.

HIGHLIGHT: Here we propose ERP, Entropy-Reinforced Planning for Transformer Decoding, which employs an entropy-reinforced planning algorithm to enhance the Transformer decoding process and strike a balance between exploitation and exploration.

235, TITLE: Heterogeneous Learning Rate Scheduling for Neural Architecture Search on Long-Tailed Datasets
AUTHORS: Chenxia Tang
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we attempt to address the challenge of applying Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms, specifically the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS), to long-tailed datasets where class distribution is highly imbalanced.

236, TITLE: Forget Sharpness: Perturbed Forgetting of Model Biases Within SAM Dynamics
AUTHORS: Ankit Vani ; Frederick Tung ; Gabriel L. Oliveira ; Hossein Sharifi-Noghabi
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Instead of viewing SAM as minimizing sharpness to improve generalization, our paper considers a new perspective based on SAM's training dynamics. We propose that perturbations in SAM perform perturbed forgetting, where they discard undesirable model biases to exhibit learning signals that generalize better.

237, TITLE: Beyond The Norms: Detecting Prediction Errors in Regression Models
AUTHORS: Andres Altieri ; Marco Romanelli ; Georg Pichler ; Florence Alberge ; Pablo Piantanida
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper tackles the challenge of detecting unreliable behavior in regression algorithms, which may arise from intrinsic variability (e.g., aleatoric uncertainty) or modeling errors (e.g., model uncertainty).

238, TITLE: Reinforced Compressive Neural Architecture Search for Versatile Adversarial Robustness
AUTHORS: Dingrong Wang ; Hitesh Sapkota ; Zhiqiang Tao ; Qi Yu
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, heuristic methods cannot uniformly handle different adversarial attacks and "teacher" network capacity. To solve this challenge, we propose a Reinforced Compressive Neural Architecture Search (RC-NAS) for Versatile Adversarial Robustness.

239, TITLE: AI-Driven Predictive Analytics Approach for Early Prognosis of Chronic Kidney Disease Using Ensemble Learning and Explainable AI
AUTHORS: K M Tawsik Jawad ; Anusha Verma ; Fathi Amsaad
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: The goal of this research is to visualize dominating features, feature scores, and values exhibited for early prognosis and detection of CKD using ensemble learning and explainable AI.

240, TITLE: Data Complexity in Expressive Description Logics With Path Expressions
AUTHORS: Bartosz Bednarczyk
CATEGORY: cs.LO [cs.LO, cs.AI, cs.CC]
HIGHLIGHT: We investigate the data complexity of the satisfiability problem for the very expressive description logic ZOIQ (a.k.a. ALCHb Self reg OIQ) over quasi-forests and establish its NP-completeness.

241, TITLE: $Classi|Q\rangle$ Towards A Translation Framework To Bridge The Classical-Quantum Programming Gap
AUTHORS: MATTEO ESPOSITO et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.CL, cs.ET, cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: Quantum computing, albeit readily available as hardware or emulated on the cloud, is still far from being available in general regarding complex programming paradigms and learning curves. This vision paper introduces $Classi|Q\rangle$, a translation framework idea to bridge Classical and Quantum Computing by translating high-level programming languages, e.g., Python or C++, into a low-level language, e.g., Quantum Assembly.

242, TITLE: BTS: Bridging Text and Sound Modalities for Metadata-Aided Respiratory Sound Classification
AUTHORS: June-Woo Kim ; Miika Toikkanen ; Yera Choi ; Seoung-Eun Moon ; Ho-Young Jung
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: Respiratory sound classification (RSC) is challenging due to varied acoustic signatures, primarily influenced by patient demographics and recording environments. To address this issue, we introduce a text-audio multimodal model that utilizes metadata of respiratory sounds, which provides useful complementary information for RSC.

243, TITLE: Are Protein Language Models Compute Optimal?
AUTHORS: Yaiza Serrano ; �lvaro Ciudad ; Alexis Molina
CATEGORY: q-bio.BM [q-bio.BM, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: By adapting methodologies from NLP scaling laws, we investigated the optimal ratio between model parameters and training tokens within a fixed compute budget.

244, TITLE: MR-RawNet: Speaker Verification System with Multiple Temporal Resolutions for Variable Duration Utterances Using Raw Waveforms
AUTHORS: SEUNG-BIN KIM et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In speaker verification systems, the utilization of short utterances presents a persistent challenge, leading to performance degradation primarily due to insufficient phonetic information to characterize the speakers. To overcome this obstacle, we propose a novel structure, MR-RawNet, designed to enhance the robustness of speaker verification systems against variable duration utterances using raw waveforms.

245, TITLE: Translating Speech with Just Images
AUTHORS: Dan Oneata ; Herman Kamper
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: This approach can be used for speech translation with just images by having the audio in a different language from the generated captions. We investigate such a system on a real low-resource language, Yor\`ub\'a, and propose a Yor\`ub\'a-to-English speech translation model that leverages pretrained components in order to be able to learn in the low-resource regime.

246, TITLE: SpikePipe: Accelerated Training of Spiking Neural Networks Via Inter-Layer Pipelining and Multiprocessor Scheduling
AUTHORS: Sai Sanjeet ; Bibhu Datta Sahoo ; Keshab K. Parhi
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: Prior works have proposed various methods for training SNNs, including backpropagation-based methods.
