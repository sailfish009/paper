AUTHORS: NISHANT BALEPUR et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: We expose: 1)user/model preferences and agent success do not accurately predict which planshelp users, so common alignment feedback can misalign with helpfulness; 2) thisgap is not due to user-specific preferences, as users are similarly successfulwhen using plans they prefer/disprefer; 3) surface-level cues like brevity andquestion similarity strongly link to preferences, but such biases fail topredict helpfulness. In all, we argue aligning helpful LLMs needs feedback fromreal user interactions, not just preferences of what looks helpful, so wediscuss the plan NLP researchers can execute to solve this problem.
