We generalize this measure to a wider class of activation functions through introduction of equivalence classes of input data, analyse its mathematical and computational properties and come up with an efficient sampling strategy for its implementation.

Therefore, the goal of this review is to offer an introduction to the surprisingly deep existing connections between optimal transport and the identification of causal effects with observational data -- where optimal transport is not just a set of potential tools, but actually builds the foundation of model assumptions.
