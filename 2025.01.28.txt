HIGHLIGHT: I argue for the importance of propositional interpretability, which involves interpreting a system's mechanisms and behavior in terms of propositional attitudes: attitudes (such as belief, desire, or subjective probability) to propositions (e.g. the proposition that it is hot outside). Propositional attitudes are the central way that we interpret and explain human beings and they are likely to be central in AI too.

383, TITLE: Lightweight Weighted Average Ensemble Model for Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-Ray Images
AUTHORS: SURESH BABU NETTUR et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we propose a novel lightweight ensemble model for detecting pneumonia in children using chest X-ray images.

384, TITLE: Scaling Laws for Decoding Images from Brain Activity
AUTHORS: Hubert Banville ; Yohann Benchetrit ; St�phane d'Ascoli ; J�r�my Rapin amd Jean-R�mi King
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.LG, q-bio.NC]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we systematically compare image decoding from four types of non-invasive devices: electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), high-field functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3T fMRI) and ultra-high field (7T) fMRI.

385, TITLE: Pfungst and Clever Hans: Identifying The Unintended Cues in A Widely Used Alzheimer's Disease MRI Dataset Using Explainable Deep Learning
AUTHORS: Christian Tinauer ; Maximilian Sackl ; Rudolf Stollberger ; Stefan Ropele ; Christian Langkammer
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: This study aims to enlighten the underlying black-box nature and reveal individual contributions of T1-weighted (T1w) gray-white matter texture, volumetric information and preprocessing on classification performance.

386, TITLE: Real-Time Brain Tumor Detection in Intraoperative Ultrasound Using YOLO11: From Model Training to Deployment in The Operating Room
AUTHORS: SANTIAGO CEPEDA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We collected 2D ioUS images from the Brain Tumor Intraoperative Database (BraTioUS) and the public ReMIND dataset, annotated with expert-refined tumor labels. Using the YOLO11 architecture and its variants, we trained object detection models to identify brain tumors.
