AUTHORS: Xiaolin Sun; Feidi Liu; Zhengming Ding; ZiZhan Zheng
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, after closer investigation, we found that the effectiveness of the current defenses is due to a fundamental weakness of the existing $l_p$ norm-constrained attacks, which can barely alter the semantics of image input even under a relatively large perturbation budget. In this work, we propose SHIFT, a novel policy-agnostic diffusion-based state perturbation attack to go beyond this limitation.

AUTHORS: Chende Zheng; Ruiqi Suo; Zhoulin Ji; Jingyi Deng; Fangbin Yi; Chenhao Lin; Chao Shen

AUTHORS: Xingyu Li; Xiaolei Liu; Cheng Liu; Yixiao Xu; Kangyi Ding; Bangzhou Xin; Jia-Li Yin
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CR [CR]
HIGHLIGHT: However, as the output grows longer, controlling the termination symbols through input becomes difficult, making these methods less effective.

Based on this, we propose GMG-LDefmamba-YOLO, which contains two core modules: the Gaussian mask gear convolution module forms a gear-shaped receptive field through improved convolutional splicing to enhance the extraction of small target features and combines the Gaussian mask mechanism to dynamically modulate the feature weights to suppress complex background interference.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We revisit this paradox and show that sparsity is a surface artifact of a model-conditioned optimization bias: for a fixed pretrained model, updates consistently localize to preferred parameter regions, highly consistent across runs and largely invariant to datasets and RL recipes. We mechanistically explain these dynamics with a Three-Gate Theory: Gate I (KL Anchor) imposes a KL-constrained update; Gate II (Model Geometry) steers the step off principal directions into low-curvature, spectrum-preserving subspaces; and Gate III (Precision) hides micro-updates in non-preferred regions, making the off-principal bias appear as sparsity.

134, TITLE: EHRStruct: A Comprehensive Benchmark Framework for Evaluating Large Language Models on Structured Electronic Health Record Tasks
AUTHORS: Xiao Yang; Xuejiao Zhao; Zhiqi Shen
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.AI [AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data stores patient information in relational tables and plays a central role in clinical decision-making. Recent advances have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to process such data, showing promise across various clinical tasks.However, the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks and clearly defined tasks makes it difficult to systematically assess and compare LLM performance on structured EHR data.To address these evaluation challenges, we introduce EHRStruct, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on structured EHR tasks.EHRStruct defines 11 representative tasks spanning diverse clinical needs and includes 2,200 task-specific evaluation samples derived from two widely used EHR datasets.We use EHRStruct to evaluate 20 advanced and representative LLMs, covering both general and medical models.We further analyze key factors influencing model performance, including input formats, few-shot generalisation, and finetuning strategies, and compare results with 11 state-of-the-art LLM-based enhancement methods for structured data reasoning.

AUTHORS: Jiale Liu; Haoming Zhou; Yishu Zhu; Bingzhi Chen; Yuncheng Jiang

To address these issues, we propose a unified approach that incorporates significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling.

AUTHORS: Xianghan Du
CATEGORY: Life Studies [LIFE STUDIES]
HIGHLIGHT: In a parallel analysis, I identify opportunities where medical humanities can shape AI toward more trustworthy, equitable, and relationally sensitive practices: augmenting empathy and narrative attention with computational tools, reframing explainability as a communicative achievement rather than a technical property alone, embedding participatory design with patients and communities, renovating curricula to integrate critical data literacy with humanistic formation, and aligning governance with values such as dignity and solidarity. The article concludes by proposing a practical research and policy agenda in which humanities scholars collaborate with clinicians, patients, and engineers to evaluate AI not only by its predictive or operational performance but also by its contributions to understanding, moral repair, and shared decision-making in the everyday clinic.

We propose Cascade HQP-DETR to address these limitations.

HIGHLIGHT: Attribution-based explanation techniques capture key patterns to enhance visual interpretability; however, these patterns often lack the granularity needed for insight in fine-grained tasks, particularly in cases of model misclassification, where explanations may be insufficiently detailed. To address this limitation, we propose a fine-grained counterfactual explanation framework that generates both object-level and part-level interpretability, addressing two fundamental questions: (1) which fine-grained features contribute to model misclassification, and (2) where dominant local features influence counterfactual adjustments.

267, TITLE: Pixel-level Quality Assessment for Oriented Object Detection
AUTHORS: Yunhui Zhu; Buliao Huang
