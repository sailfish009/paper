AUTHORS: LÉNI K. LE GOFF et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: To address this, we propose a framework that combines an evolutionary algorithm to generate body-plans and a learning algorithm to optimise the parameters of a neural controller where the topology of this controller is created once the body-plan of each offspring body-plan is generated.

90, TITLE: Characterization of Time-variant and Time-invariant Assessment of Suicidality on Reddit Using C-SSRS
AUTHORS: MANAS GAUR et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.AI, cs.CL, H.4; I.2; J.3; J.4]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we address this knowledge gap by developing deep learning algorithms to assess suicide risk in terms of severity and temporality from Reddit data based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).

91, TITLE: Flavored Tacotron: Conditional Learning for Prosodic-linguistic Features
AUTHORS: Mahsa Elyasi ; Gaurav Bharaj
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CL, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we propose a novel carefully designed strategy for conditioning Tacotron-2 on two fundamental prosodic features in English -- stress syllable and pitch accent, that help achieve more natural prosody.

92, TITLE: Feature Replacement and Combination for Hybrid ASR Systems
AUTHORS: Peter Vieting ; Christoph Lüscher ; Wilfried Michel ; Ralf Schlüter ; Hermann Ney
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: Acoustic modeling of raw waveform and learning feature extractors as part of the neural network classifier has been the goal of many studies in the area of automatic speech recognition (ASR).

93, TITLE: Improved TB Classification Using Bone-suppressed Chest Radiographs
AUTHORS: Sivaramakrishnan Rajaraman ; Ghada Zamzmi ; Les Folio ; Philip Alderson ; Sameer Antani
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, I.4.5]
HIGHLIGHT: This study aims to build a deep learning (DL)-based bone suppression model that identifies and removes these occluding bony structures in frontal CXRs to assist in reducing errors in radiological interpretation, including DL workflows, related to detecting manifestations consistent with Tuberculosis (TB).

94, TITLE: DenResCov-19: A Deep Transfer Learning Network for Robust Automatic Classification of COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis from X-rays
AUTHORS: MICHAIL MAMALAKIS et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this regard, the objective of this work is to develop a new deep transfer learning pipeline to diagnose patients with COVID-19, pneumonia, and tuberculosis, based on chest x-ray images.

95, TITLE: X2CT-FLOW: Reconstruction of Multiple Volumetric Chest Computed Tomography Images with Different Likelihoods from A Uni- or Biplanar Chest X-ray Image Using A Flow-based Generative Model
AUTHORS: HISAICHI SHIBATA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose X2CT-FLOW for the reconstruction of volumetric chest computed tomography (CT) images from uni- or biplanar digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) or chest X-ray (CXR) images on the basis of a flow-based deep generative (FDG) model.
