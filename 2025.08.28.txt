1, TITLE: Multimodal Prototype Alignment for Semi-supervised Pathology Image Segmentation
AUTHORS: MINGXI FU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Pathological image segmentation faces numerous challenges, particularly dueto ambiguous semantic boundaries and the high cost of pixel-level annotations.Although recent semi-supervised methods based on consistency regularization(e.g., UniMatch) have made notable progress, they mainly rely onperturbation-based consistency within the image modality, making it difficultto capture high-level semantic priors, especially in structurally complexpathology images. To address these limitations, we propose MPAMatch - a novelsegmentation framework that performs pixel-level contrastive learning under amultimodal prototype-guided supervision paradigm.
