HIGHLIGHT: Specifically, we introduce a feature we call a tagging system: it modifies how individuals can perceive each other and is expected to increase behavioral complexity.

164, TITLE: CaveSeg: Deep Semantic Segmentation and Scene Parsing for Autonomous Underwater Cave Exploration
AUTHORS: A. ABDULLAH et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV, eess.IV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we present CaveSeg - the first visual learning pipeline for semantic segmentation and scene parsing for AUV navigation inside underwater caves.

165, TITLE: Enhancing Motion Trajectory Segmentation of Rigid Bodies Using A Novel Screw-based Trajectory-shape Representation
AUTHORS: Arno Verduyn ; Maxim Vochten ; Joris De Schutter
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose a novel trajectory representation for rigid-body motions that incorporates both translation and rotation, and additionally exhibits several invariant properties.

166, TITLE: EDMP: Ensemble-of-costs-guided Diffusion for Motion Planning
AUTHORS: KALLOL SAHA et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose EDMP, an Ensemble-of-costs-guided Diffusion for Motion Planning that aims to combine the strengths of classical and deep-learning-based motion planning.

167, TITLE: STARNet: Sensor Trustworthiness and Anomaly Recognition Via Approximated Likelihood Regret for Robust Edge Autonomy
AUTHORS: NASTARAN DARABI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In parallel, the limited availability of training data on complex sensors also affects the reliability of their deep learning-based prediction flow, where their prediction models can fail to generalize to environments not adequately captured in the training set. To address these reliability concerns, this paper introduces STARNet, a Sensor Trustworthiness and Anomaly Recognition Network designed to detect untrustworthy sensor streams that may arise from sensor malfunctions and/or challenging environments.

168, TITLE: A Large-scale Dataset for Audio-Language Representation Learning
AUTHORS: Luoyi Sun ; Xuenan Xu ; Mengyue Wu ; Weidi Xie
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.CV, cs.MM, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: However, in the audio representation learning community, the present audio-language datasets suffer from limitations such as insufficient volume, simplistic content, and arduous collection procedures. To tackle these challenges, we present an innovative and automatic audio caption generation pipeline based on a series of public tools or APIs, and construct a large-scale, high-quality, audio-language dataset, named as Auto-ACD, comprising over 1.9M audio-text pairs.

169, TITLE: Embed-Search-Align: DNA Sequence Alignment Using Transformer Models
AUTHORS: PAVAN HOLUR et. al.
CATEGORY: q-bio.GN [q-bio.GN, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Performance at sequence classification tasks does not, however, translate to sequence alignment, where it is necessary to conduct a genome-wide search to successfully align every read. We address this open problem by framing it as an Embed-Search-Align task.

170, TITLE: Leveraging Data Collection and Unsupervised Learning for Code-switched Tunisian Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition
AUTHORS: Ahmed Amine Ben Abdallah ; Ata Kabboudi ; Amir Kanoun ; Salah Zaiem
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we address the aforementioned ASR challenge, focusing on the Tunisian dialect.

171, TITLE: End-to-End Speech Recognition Contextualization with Large Language Models
AUTHORS: EGOR LAKOMKIN et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we introduce a novel method for contextualizing speech recognition models incorporating LLMs.

172, TITLE: Speak While You Think: Streaming Speech Synthesis During Text Generation
AUTHORS: AVIHU DEKEL et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose LLM2Speech, an architecture to synthesize speech while text is being generated by an LLM which yields significant latency reduction.

173, TITLE: CalibFPA: A Focal Plane Array Imaging System Based on Online Deep-Learning Calibration
AUTHORS: ALPER G�NG�R et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]

174, TITLE: More Complex Encoder Is Not All You Need
AUTHORS: WEIBIN YANG et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: To address the gap in relevant research, we extend our focus beyond the encoder and introduce neU-Net (i.e., not complex encoder U-Net), which incorporates a novel Sub-pixel Convolution for upsampling to construct a powerful decoder.

175, TITLE: Language-Oriented Communication with Semantic Coding and Knowledge Distillation for Text-to-Image Generation
AUTHORS: Hyelin Nam ; Jihong Park ; Jinho Choi ; Mehdi Bennis ; Seong-Lyun Kim
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: In LSC, machines communicate using human language messages that can be interpreted and manipulated via natural language processing (NLP) techniques for SC efficiency. To demonstrate LSC's potential, we introduce three innovative algorithms: 1) semantic source coding (SSC) which compresses a text prompt into its key head words capturing the prompt's syntactic essence while maintaining their appearance order to keep the prompt's context; 2) semantic channel coding (SCC) that improves robustness against errors by substituting head words with their lenghthier synonyms; and 3) semantic knowledge distillation (SKD) that produces listener-customized prompts via in-context learning the listener's language style.
