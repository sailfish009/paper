37, TITLE: Task Residual for Tuning Vision-Language Models
AUTHORS: Tao Yu ; Zhihe Lu ; Xin Jin ; Zhibo Chen ; Xinchao Wang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, most existing efficient transfer learning (ETL) approaches for VLMs either damage or are excessively biased towards the prior knowledge, e.g., prompt tuning (PT) discards the pre-trained text-based classifier and builds a new one while adapter-style tuning (AT) fully relies on the pre-trained features. To address this, we propose a new efficient tuning approach for VLMs named Task Residual Tuning (TaskRes), which performs directly on the text-based classifier and explicitly decouples the prior knowledge of the pre-trained models and new knowledge regarding a target task.

46, TITLE: Stereo Image Rain Removal Via Dual-View Mutual Attention
AUTHORS: YANYAN WEI et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing stereo rain removal methods still cannot make full use of the complementary information between two views, and we find it is because: 1) the rain streaks have more complex distributions in directions and densities, which severely damage the complementary information and pose greater challenges; 2) the disparity estimation is not accurate enough due to the imperfect fusion mechanism for the features between two views. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new \underline{Stereo} \underline{I}mage \underline{R}ain \underline{R}emoval method (StereoIRR) via sufficient interaction between two views, which incorporates: 1) a new Dual-view Mutual Attention (DMA) mechanism which generates mutual attention maps by taking left and right views as key information for each other to facilitate cross-view feature fusion; 2) a long-range and cross-view interaction, which is constructed with basic blocks and dual-view mutual attention, can alleviate the adverse effect of rain on complementary information to help the features of stereo images to get long-range and cross-view interaction and fusion.

51, TITLE: Knowing What to Label for Few Shot Microscopy Image Cell Segmentation
AUTHORS: Youssef Dawoud ; Arij Bouazizi ; Katharina Ernst ; Gustavo Carneiro ; Vasileios Belagiannis
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In microscopy image cell segmentation, it is common to train a deep neural network on source data, containing different types of microscopy images, and then fine-tune it using a support set comprising a few randomly selected and annotated training target images. In this paper, we argue that the random selection of unlabelled training target images to be annotated and included in the support set may not enable an effective fine-tuning process, so we propose a new approach to optimise this image selection process.

64, TITLE: Informative Sample-Aware Proxy for Deep Metric Learning
AUTHORS: Aoyu Li ; Ikuro Sato ; Kohta Ishikawa ; Rei Kawakami ; Rio Yokota
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.IR]
HIGHLIGHT: In existing methods, a relatively small number of samples can produce large gradient magnitudes (ie, hard samples), and a relatively large number of samples can produce small gradient magnitudes (ie, easy samples); these can play a major part in updates. Assuming that acquiring too much sensitivity to such extreme sets of samples would deteriorate the generalizability of a method, we propose a novel proxy-based method called Informative Sample-Aware Proxy (Proxy-ISA), which directly modifies a gradient weighting factor for each sample using a scheduled threshold function, so that the model is more sensitive to the informative samples.
