AUTHORS: Xiangyu Fan; Zesong Qiu; Zhuguanyu Wu; Fanzhou Wang; Zhiqian Lin; Tianxiang Ren; Dahua Lin; Ruihao Gong; Lei Yang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memoryusage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potentialsolution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity ofmulti-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-stepcounterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-stepdistillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation withMixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing modelcapacity.

AUTHORS: Junkang Liu; Fanhua Shang; Kewen Zhu; Hongying Liu; Yuanyuan Liu; Jin Liu
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, directly applying AdamW in federated learningsettings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamWoften yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2)the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializingmoment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows downconvergence.
