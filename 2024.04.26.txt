Our main contribution is to identify graph parameters that, when $H$-SUBGRAPH HITTING is parameterized by the vertex-deletion distance to a class $C$ where any of these parameters is bounded, and assuming standard complexity assumptions and that $H$ is biconnected, allow us to prove the following sharp dichotomy: the problem admits a polynomial kernel if and only if $H$ is a clique.
