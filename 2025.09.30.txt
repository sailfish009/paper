HIGHLIGHT: Wequestion that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frameis a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, aunified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including fullframes, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes.Among these designs, we find model video generation using\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressivemodels to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomicunits for video autoregression.

In this work, we introduce DEFT,Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework thatadapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into twocomponents with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement ofa low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update.The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the othertrainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within thatsubspace.

HIGHLIGHT: Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinctways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learnedduring training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts.Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it isparamount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularlywhether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantiallydifferent mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this atthe mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, featuredirections representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream,and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions.

CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-worldmultimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data;Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models toaddress privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modalknowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leadingto reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning;to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning(CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visualunlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visualrepresentations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledgeretention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semanticconsistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the modelperformance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn setand retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate thesuperiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement withonly 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

AUTHORS: Keisuke Otaki ; Akihisa Okada ; Tadayoshi Matsumori ; Hiroaki Yoshida
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: A challenge with using circular geofences in urban andhigh-resolution areas is that they often overlap and fail to align withpolitical district boundaries and road segments, such as one-way streets andmedian barriers. In this study, we address the problem of extracting arbitraryshapes as geofences from human mobility data to mitigate this problem.

823, TITLE: S$^3$F-Net: A Multi-Modal Approach to Medical Image Classification Via Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network
AUTHORS: Md. Saiful Bari Siddiqui ; Mohammed Imamul Hassan Bhuiyan
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.SP]
HIGHLIGHT: Convolutional Neural Networks have become a cornerstone of medical imageanalysis due to their proficiency in learning hierarchical spatial features.However, this focus on a single domain is inefficient at capturing global,holistic patterns and fails to explicitly model an image's frequency-domaincharacteristics. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatial-SpectralSummarizer Fusion Network (S$^3$F-Net), a dual-branch framework that learnsfrom both spatial and spectral representations simultaneously.

824, TITLE: Introducing Multimodal Paradigm for Learning Sleep Staging PSG Via General-Purpose Model
AUTHORS: JIANHENG ZHOU et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.SP [eess.SP, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing automatic methods typically extract features fromcomplex polysomnography (PSG) signals and train domain-specific models, whichoften lack intuitiveness and require large, specialized datasets. To overcomethese limitations, we introduce a new paradigm for sleep staging that leverageslarge multimodal general-purpose models to emulate clinical diagnosticpractices.
