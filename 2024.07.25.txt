AUTHORS: Xintian Mao ; Jiansheng Wang ; Xingran Xie ; Qingli Li ; Yan Wang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Due to the computational complexity of self-attention (SA), prevalent techniques for image deblurring often resort to either adopting localized SA or employing coarse-grained global SA methods, both of which exhibit drawbacks such as compromising global modeling or lacking fine-grained correlation. In order to address this issue by effectively modeling long-range dependencies without sacrificing fine-grained details, we introduce a novel approach termed Local Frequency Transformer (LoFormer).

AUTHORS: Farzeen Munir ; Tomasz Piotr Kucner
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.RO]

AUTHORS: TIANHANG NAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, q-bio.TO]
HIGHLIGHT: Previous MIL researches have primarily focused on enhancing feature aggregators for globally analyzing WSIs, but overlook a causal relationship in diagnosis: model's prediction should ideally stem solely from regions of the image that contain diagnostic evidence (such as tumor cells), which usually occupy relatively small areas. To address this limitation and establish the truly causal relationship between model predictions and diagnostic evidence regions, we propose Causal Inference Multiple Instance Learning (CI-MIL).

125, TITLE: FIIH: Fully Invertible Image Hiding for Secure and Robust
AUTHORS: Lang Huang ; Lin Huo ; Zheng Gan ; Xinrong He
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing image hiding methods have a serious problem that the hiding and revealing process cannot be fully invertible, which results in the revealing network not being able to recover the secret image losslessly, which makes it impossible to simultaneously achieve high fidelity and secure transmission of the secret image in an insecure network environment. To solve this problem,this paper proposes a fully invertible image hiding architecture based on invertible neural network,aiming to realize invertible hiding of secret images,which is invertible on both data and network.

144, TITLE: Gradient-based Inference of Abstract Task Representations for Generalization in Neural Networks
AUTHORS: ALI HUMMOS et. al.

To tackle this, we cast task inference as an optimization problem from a variational inference perspective and ground our approach in an expectation-maximization framework.

147, TITLE: Continual Learning in Bio-plausible Spiking Neural Networks with Hebbian and Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity: A Survey and Perspective
AUTHORS: Ali Safa
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE]
HIGHLIGHT: A key differentiating factor regarding this emerging class of neuromorphic continual learning system lies in the fact that learning must be carried using a data stream received in its natural order, as opposed to conventional gradient-based offline training where a static training dataset is assumed available a priori and randomly shuffled to make the training set independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). In contrast, the emerging class of neuromorphic continual learning systems covered in this survey must learn to integrate new information on the fly in a non-i.i.d manner, which makes these systems subject to catastrophic forgetting.
