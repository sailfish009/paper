HIGHLIGHT: Hence, this work proposes an evaluation framework for molecule generation techniques in MTDD scenarios, considering brain diseases as a case study.

234, TITLE: Kotlin's Type System Is (Also) Unsound
AUTHORS: Elad Kinsbruner ; Hila Peleg ; Shachar Itzhaky
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL, cs.SE]
HIGHLIGHT: Our new proof, which is an infringing code snippet, utilizes Kotlin's \emph{declaration-site} variance specification and does not require implicit null values. We present this counterexample to soundness in full along with detailed explanations of every step.

235, TITLE: The Psychological Impacts of Algorithmic and AI-Driven Social Media on Teenagers: A Call to Action
AUTHORS: Sunil Arora ; Sahil Arora ; John D. Hastings
CATEGORY: cs.SI [cs.SI, cs.AI, cs.CY, cs.HC, H.5.2; I.2.6; J.4; H.3.5]
HIGHLIGHT: This study investigates the meta-issues surrounding social media, which, while theoretically designed to enhance social interactions and improve our social lives by facilitating the sharing of personal experiences and life events, often results in adverse psychological impacts.

236, TITLE: BrewCLIP: A Bifurcated Representation Learning Framework for Audio-Visual Retrieval
AUTHORS: Zhenyu Lu ; Lakshay Sethi
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we investigate whether non-textual information, which is overlooked by pipeline-based models, can be leveraged to improve speech-image matching performance.

237, TITLE: A Wild Sheep Chase Through An Orchard
AUTHORS: Jordan Dempsey ; Leo van Iersel ; Mark Jones ; Yukihiro Murakami ; Norbert Zeh
CATEGORY: q-bio.PE [q-bio.PE, cs.CC, math.CO]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we prove that deciding whether an undirected, binary phylogenetic network is an orchard -- or equivalently, whether it has an orientation that makes it a rooted orchard -- is NP-hard. For this, we introduce a new characterization of undirected orchards which could be useful for proving positive results.

238, TITLE: SSL-TTS: Leveraging Self-Supervised Embeddings and KNN Retrieval for Zero-Shot Multi-speaker TTS
AUTHORS: Karl El Hajal ; Ajinkya Kulkarni ; Enno Hermann ; Mathew Magimai. -Doss
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we introduce SSL-TTS, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot TTS framework trained on transcribed speech from a single speaker.

239, TITLE: ISLES'24: Improving Final Infarct Prediction in Ischemic Stroke Using Multimodal Imaging and Clinical Data
AUTHORS: EZEQUIEL DE LA ROSA et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This work presents the ISLES'24 challenge, which addresses final post-treatment stroke infarct prediction from pre-interventional acute stroke imaging and clinical data.

240, TITLE: A Tutorial on Explainable Image Classification for Dementia Stages Using Convolutional Neural Network and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
AUTHORS: Kevin Kam Fung Yuen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents a tutorial of an explainable approach using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to classify four progressive dementia stages based on open MRI brain images.

241, TITLE: CO2Wounds-V2: Extended Chronic Wounds Dataset From Leprosy Patients
AUTHORS: KAREN SANCHEZ et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces the CO2Wounds-V2 dataset, an extended collection of RGB wound images from leprosy patients with their corresponding semantic segmentation annotations, aiming to enhance the development and testing of image-processing algorithms in the medical field.
