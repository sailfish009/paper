94, TITLE: Image-Text Co-Decomposition for Text-Supervised Semantic Segmentation
AUTHORS: JI-JIA WU et. al.

To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, Image-Text Co-Decomposition (CoDe), where the paired image and text are jointly decomposed into a set of image regions and a set of word segments, respectively, and contrastive learning is developed to enforce region-word alignment.
