CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored.

105, TITLE: Prototype-Based Semantic Consistency Alignment for Domain Adaptive Retrieval
AUTHORS: Tianle Hu; Weijun Lv; Na Han; Xiaozhao Fang; Jie Wen; Jiaxing Li; Guoxu Zhou
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.LG [LG]
HIGHLIGHT: However, existing methods encounter several fundamental limitations: 1) neglecting class-level semantic alignment and excessively pursuing pair-wise sample alignment; 2) lacking either pseudo-label reliability consideration or geometric guidance for assessing label correctness; 3) directly quantizing original features affected by domain shift, undermining the quality of learned hash codes. In view of these limitations, we propose Prototype-Based Semantic Consistency Alignment (PSCA), a two-stage framework for effective domain adaptive retrieval.

106, TITLE: BiTAgent: A Task-Aware Modular Framework for Bidirectional Coupling Between Multimodal Large Language Models and World Models
AUTHORS: Yu-Wei Zhan; Xin Wang; Pengzhe Mao; Tongtong Feng; Ren Wang; Wenwu Zhu

HIGHLIGHT: Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs.

HIGHLIGHT: Incorporating physical motion modeling is crucial for deeper video understanding, but presents three key challenges: (1) motion signals are often entangled with appearance variations, making it difficult to extract clean physical cues; (2) effective motion modeling requires not only continuous-time motion representations but also capturing physical dynamics; and (3) collecting accurate annotations for physical attributes is costly and often impractical. To address these issues, we propose PhyVLLM, a physical-guided video-language framework that explicitly incorporates physical motion into Video LLMs.

137, TITLE: Shift-Window Meets Dual Attention: A Multi-Model Architecture for Specular Highlight Removal
AUTHORS: Tianci Huo; Lingfeng Qi; Yuhan Chen; Qihong Xue; Jinyuan Shao; Hai Yu; Jie Li; Zhanhua Zhang; Guofa Li
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Although there exist considerable methods that focus on local information from convolutional neural network models or global information from transformer models, the single-type model falls into a modeling dilemma between local fine-grained details and global long-range dependencies, thus deteriorating for specular highlights with different scales. Therefore, to accommodate specular highlights of all scales, we propose a multi-model architecture for specular highlight removal (MM-SHR) that effectively captures fine-grained features in highlight regions and models long-range dependencies between highlight and highlight-free areas.
