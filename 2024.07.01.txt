HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we demonstrate the potential to reduce Ansor's search time while enhancing kernel quality by incorporating Droplet Search, an AutoTVM algorithm, into Ansor's exploration phase.

161, TITLE: Model Predictive Simulation Using Structured Graphical Models and Transformers
AUTHORS: Xinghua Lou ; Meet Dave ; Shrinu Kushagra ; Miguel Lazaro-Gredilla ; Kevin Murphy
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose an approach to simulating trajectories of multiple interacting agents (road users) based on transformers and probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), and apply it to the Waymo SimAgents challenge.

162, TITLE: Too Good to Be True? Turn Any Model Differentially Private With DP-Weights
AUTHORS: David Zagardo
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR]
HIGHLIGHT: In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking approach (to our knowledge) that applies differential privacy noise to the model's weights after training.

163, TITLE: BMW Agents -- A Framework For Task Automation Through Multi-agent Collaboration
AUTHORS: NOEL CRAWFORD et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.MA [cs.MA, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we focus on designing a flexible agent engineering framework with careful attention to planning and execution, capable of handling complex use case applications across various domains.

164, TITLE: Efficient and Distributed Large-Scale 3D Map Registration Using Tomographic Features
AUTHORS: Halil Utku Unlu ; Anthony Tzes ; Prashanth Krishnamurthy ; Farshad Khorrami
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: A robust, resource-efficient, distributed, and minimally parameterized 3D map matching and merging algorithm is proposed. The suggested algorithm utilizes tomographic features from 2D projections of horizontal cross-sections of gravity-aligned local maps, and matches these projection slices at all possible height differences, enabling the estimation of four degrees of freedom in an efficient and parallelizable manner.

165, TITLE: Function+Data Flow: A Framework to Specify Machine Learning Pipelines for Digital Twinning
AUTHORS: Eduardo de Conto ; Blaise Genest ; Arvind Easwaran
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Here we propose Function+Data Flow (FDF), a domain-specific language (DSL) to describe AI pipelines within DTs.

166, TITLE: Robustness Testing of Black-Box Models Against CT Degradation Through Test-Time Augmentation
AUTHORS: JACK HIGHTON et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.med-ph]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work we present this framework by demonstrating that given the same training data, the model architecture and data pre processing greatly affect the robustness of several frequently used segmentation and object detection methods to simulated CT imaging artifacts and degradation.

167, TITLE: Malaria Cell Detection Using Deep Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Saurabh Sawant ; Anurag Singh
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: This project aims to automate the detection of malaria-infected cells using a deep learning approach.

168, TITLE: High-resolution Segmentations of The Hypothalamus and Its Subregions for Training of Segmentation Models
AUTHORS: LIVIA RODRIGUES et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Here we provide HELM, Hypothalamic ex vivo Label Maps, a dataset composed of label maps built from publicly available ultra-high resolution ex vivo MRI from 10 whole hemispheres, which can be used to develop segmentation methods using synthetic data.

169, TITLE: Enhancing Radiological Diagnosis: A Collaborative Approach Integrating AI and Human Expertise for Visual Miss Correction
AUTHORS: Akash Awasthi ; Ngan Le ; Zhigang Deng ; Carol C. Wu ; Hien Van Nguyen
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.HC]
HIGHLIGHT: This study aimed to develop a collaborative AI system, CoRaX, which integrates eye gaze data and radiology reports to enhance diagnostic accuracy in chest radiology by pinpointing perceptual errors and refining the decision-making process.
