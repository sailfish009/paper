We address these issues by introducing a novel method composed of two key components: (1) Elliptical Error Clustering and Error Correcting Splat Addition that pinpoints dynamic areas to improve and initialize fitting splats, and (2) Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting that improves consistency of mapping between splats and represented dynamic objects.

CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization.

AUTHORS: Nguyen Duy Hung; ; Thanaruk Theeramunkong; Van-Nam Huynh
CATEGORY: Journal of Advanced Computational Intelligence and ... [JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND ...]
HIGHLIGHT: Since an expert user knows that the extracted explanation aims to be just analogous to the target/ideal explanation, the expert user has to use analogical arguments to transfer certain properties observed on the former to the latter. In this paper, assuming an expert user whose knowledge satisfies certain conjectures, we reconstruct the structures “ reason therefore conclusion ” of these analogical arguments and study conditions for ensuring the truth of the reason , conditions for ensuring that the conclusion follows necessarily from the reason , as well as counter-arguments the user has to consider.

AUTHORS: Gaurav Rudravaram; Lianrui Zuo; Adam M. Saunders; Michael E. Kim; Praitayini Kanakaraj; Nancy R. Newlin; Aravind R. Krishnan; Elyssa M. McMaster; Chloe Cho; Susan M. Resnick; Lori L. Beason Held; Derek Archer; Timothy J. Hohman; Daniel C. Moyer; Bennett A. Landman
CATEGORY: arxiv-q-bio.NC [NC]
HIGHLIGHT: While low-dimensional spaces like PCA and autoencoders are often used to capture major sources of variation, their latent spaces are generally continuous and cannot fully reflect the mixed nature of variability in connectomes, which include both continuous (e.g., connectivity strength) and discrete factors (e.g., imaging site). Motivated by this, we propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a hybrid latent space that jointly models the discrete and continuous components.

177, TITLE: KRAL: Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning for LLM-assisted Clinical Antimicrobial Therapy
AUTHORS: Zhe Li; Yehan Qiu; Yujie Chen; Xiang Zhou

To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency.
