296, TITLE: SnappyMeal: Design and Longitudinal Evaluation of A Multimodal AI Food Logging Application
AUTHORS: Liam Bakar; Zachary Englhardt; Vidya Srinivas; Girish Narayanswamy; Dilini Nissanka; Shwetak Patel; Vikram Iyer
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.HC [HC]
HIGHLIGHT: Food logging, both self-directed and prescribed, plays a critical role inuncovering correlations between diet, medical, fitness, and health outcomes.Through conversations with nutritional experts and individuals who practicedietary tracking, we find current logging methods, such as handwritten andapp-based journaling, are inflexible and result in low adherence andpotentially inaccurate nutritional summaries. These findings, corroborated byprior literature, emphasize the urgent need for improved food logging methods.In response, we propose SnappyMeal, an AI-powered dietary tracking system thatleverages multimodal inputs to enable users to more flexibly log their foodintake.
