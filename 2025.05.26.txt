In this paper, we identify the connection between the output of the encoder (a stack of convolutional layers) and the ensuing dense layers as the main underlying factor limiting scaling capabilities; we denote this connection as the bottleneck, and we demonstrate that previous approaches implicitly target this bottleneck.

To address this, we present MMMG, a comprehensive and human-aligned benchmark for multimodal generation across 4 modality combinations (image, audio, interleaved text and image, interleaved text and audio), with a focus on tasks that present significant challenges for generation models, while still enabling reliable automatic evaluation through a combination of models and programs.

AUTHORS: Xinran Gu ; Kaifeng Lyu ; Jiazheng Li ; Jingzhao Zhang
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained on data mixtures: most data come from web scrapes, while a small portion is curated from high-quality sources with dense domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we show that when training LLMs on such data mixtures, knowledge acquisition from knowledge-dense datasets, unlike training exclusively on knowledge-dense data (arXiv:2404.05405), does not always follow a smooth scaling law but can exhibit phase transitions with respect to the mixing ratio and model size.

To address these limitations, we introduce ConfRover, an autoregressive model that simultaneously learns protein conformation and dynamics from MD trajectories, supporting both time-dependent and time-independent sampling.

34, TITLE: L-MTP: Leap Multi-Token Prediction Beyond Adjacent Context for Large Language Models
AUTHORS: XIAOHAO LIU et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: Despite their success, next-token prediction (NTP), the dominant method for LLM training and inference, is constrained in both contextual coverage and inference efficiency due to its inherently sequential process. To overcome these challenges, we propose leap multi-token prediction~(L-MTP), an innovative token prediction method that extends the capabilities of multi-token prediction (MTP) by introducing a leap-based mechanism.

52, TITLE: Stable Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Reasoning
AUTHORS: Muzhi Dai ; Shixuan Liu ; Qingyi Si
CATEGORY: cs.AI [cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Nevertheless, we observe that these length-penalty reward functions exacerbate RL training instability: as the completion length decreases, model accuracy abruptly collapses, often occurring early in training. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution GRPO-$\lambda$, an efficient and stabilized variant of GRPO, which dynamically adjusts the reward strategy by monitoring the correctness ratio among completions within each query-sampled group.

78, TITLE: BehaveGPT: A Foundation Model for Large-scale User Behavior Modeling
AUTHORS: JIAHUI GONG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.IR [cs.IR, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In recent years, foundational models have revolutionized the fields of language and vision, demonstrating remarkable abilities in understanding and generating complex data; however, similar advances in user behavior modeling have been limited, largely due to the complexity of behavioral data and the challenges involved in capturing intricate temporal and contextual relationships in user activities. To address this, we propose BehaveGPT, a foundational model designed specifically for large-scale user behavior prediction.

79, TITLE: Explaining Sources of Uncertainty in Automated Fact-Checking
AUTHORS: Jingyi Sun ; Greta Warren ; Irina Shklovski ; Isabelle Augenstein
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Prior work proposes using numerical uncertainty or hedges ("I'm not sure, but ..."), which do not explain uncertainty that arises from conflicting evidence, leaving users unable to resolve disagreements or rely on the output. We introduce CLUE (Conflict-and-Agreement-aware Language-model Uncertainty Explanations), the first framework to generate natural language explanations of model uncertainty by (i) identifying relationships between spans of text that expose claim-evidence or inter-evidence conflicts and agreements that drive the model's predictive uncertainty in an unsupervised way, and (ii) generating explanations via prompting and attention steering that verbalize these critical interactions.

AUTHORS: HANG YUAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: Modern reasoning models, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, exhibit impressive problem-solving capabilities but suffer from critical inefficiencies: high inference latency, excessive computational resource consumption, and a tendency toward overthinking -- generating verbose chains of thought (CoT) laden with redundant tokens that contribute minimally to the final answer. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Token Selection (CTS), a token-level compression framework with a flexible and variable compression ratio that identifies and preserves only the most essential tokens in CoT.

154, TITLE: Temporal Consistency Constrained Transferable Adversarial Attacks with Background Mixup for Action Recognition
AUTHORS: Ping Li ; Jianan Ni ; Bo Pang
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Existing transferable attack methods face two major challenges: 1) they heavily rely on the assumption that the decision boundaries of the surrogate (a.k.a., source) model and the target model are similar, which limits the adversarial transferability; and 2) their decision boundary difference makes the attack direction uncertain, which may result in the gradient oscillation, weakening the adversarial attack. This motivates us to propose a Background Mixup-induced Temporal Consistency (BMTC) attack method for action recognition.

AUTHORS: Yuchen Zhang ; Yaxiong Wang ; Yujiao Wu ; Lianwei Wu ; Li Zhu
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: While existing methods have made progress in recent years, we identify two fundamental limitations in current approaches: (1) Underestimation of MLLM-driven deception risk: prevailing techniques primarily address rule-based text manipulations, yet fail to account for sophisticated misinformation synthesized by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that can dynamically generate semantically coherent, contextually plausible yet deceptive narratives conditioned on manipulated images; (2) Unrealistic misalignment artifacts: currently focused scenarios rely on artificially misaligned content that lacks semantic coherence, rendering them easily detectable. To address these gaps holistically, we propose a new adversarial pipeline that leverages MLLMs to generate high-risk disinformation.

CATEGORY: cs.CC [cs.CC, cs.DS]
HIGHLIGHT: This line of work is supported by the low-degree conjecture of Hopkins, which postulates that a vanishing degree-$D$ LDA implies the absence of any noise-tolerant distinguishing algorithm with runtime $n^{\widetilde{O}(D)}$ whenever 1) the null distribution is product on $\{0,1\}^{\binom{n}{k}}$, and 2) the planted distribution is permutation invariant, that is, invariant under any relabeling $[n] \rightarrow [n]$.

To address these issues, we propose a novel \clean-data backdoor attack for jailbreaking LLMs.

HIGHLIGHT: However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale.

To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel structured approach: rather than directly answering causal queries, we provide the model with the capability to structure its thinking by guiding the model to build a structured knowledge graph, systematically encoding the provided correlational premises, to answer the causal queries.

395, TITLE: A Multi-Head Attention Soft Random Forest for Interpretable Patient No-Show Prediction
AUTHORS: Ninda Nurseha Amalina ; Kwadwo Boateng Ofori-Amanfo ; Heungjo An
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CY]
