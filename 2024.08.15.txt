78, TITLE: All-around Neural Collapse for Imbalanced Classification
AUTHORS: Enhao Zhang ; Chaohua Li ; Chuanxing Geng ; Songcan Chen
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: Consequently, reconstructing NC solely at the classifier aspect may be futile, as the feature means remain compressed, leading to the violation of inherent \textit{self-duality} in NC (\textit{i.e.}, class means and classifier vectors converge mutually) and incidentally, resulting in an unsatisfactory collapse of individual activations towards the corresponding class means. To shake off these dilemmas, we present a unified \textbf{All}-around \textbf{N}eural \textbf{C}ollapse framework (AllNC), aiming to comprehensively restore NC across multiple aspects including individual activations, class means and classifier vectors.
