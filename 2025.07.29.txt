AUTHORS: CHENGKAI WANG et. al.

HIGHLIGHT: This approachoffers a robust and trustworthy biomarker for methamphetamine addiction.Validation experiments show that NeuroCLIP significantly improvesdiscriminative capabilities among the methamphetamine-dependent individuals andhealthy controls compared to models using either EEG or only fNIRS alone.Furthermore, the proposed framework facilitates objective, brain-basedevaluation of rTMS treatment efficacy, demonstrating measurable shifts inneural patterns towards healthy control profiles after treatment. Critically,we establish the trustworthiness of the multimodal data-driven biomarker byshowing its strong correlation with psychometrically validated craving scores.These findings suggest that biomarker derived from EEG-fNIRS data via NeuroCLIPoffers enhanced robustness and reliability over single-modality approaches,providing a valuable tool for addiction neuroscience research and potentiallyimproving clinical assessments.
