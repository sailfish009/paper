1, TITLE: Humanity's Last Exam
AUTHORS: LONG PHAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve over 90\% accuracy on popular benchmarks like MMLU, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. In response, we introduce Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be the final closed-ended academic benchmark of its kind with broad subject coverage.

2, TITLE: Communicating Activations Between Language Model Agents
AUTHORS: Vignav Ramesh ; Kenneth Li
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While natural language has been the dominant medium for inter-LM communication, it is not obvious this should be the standard: not only does natural language communication incur high inference costs that scale quickly with the number of both agents and messages, but also the decoding process abstracts away too much rich information that could be otherwise accessed from the internal activations. In this work, we propose a simple technique whereby LMs communicate via activations; concretely, we pause an LM $\textit{B}$'s computation at an intermediate layer, combine its current activation with another LM $\textit{A}$'s intermediate activation via some function $\textit{f}$, then pass $\textit{f}$'s output into the next layer of $\textit{B}$ and continue the forward pass till decoding is complete.

To address this limitation, we present \textbf{ReferDINO}, an end-to-end RVOS model that inherits strong vision-language understanding from the pretrained visual grounding foundation models, and is further endowed with effective temporal understanding and object segmentation capabilities.

168, TITLE: Decoding Generalization from Memorization in Deep Neural Networks
AUTHORS: Simran Ketha ; Venkatakrishnan Ramaswamy

Here, we provide evidence for the latter possibility by demonstrating, empirically, that such models possess information in their representations for substantially improved generalization, even in the face of memorization.
