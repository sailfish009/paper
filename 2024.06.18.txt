AUTHORS: Eden Saig ; Ohad Einav ; Inbal Talgam-Cohen
CATEGORY: cs.GT [cs.GT, cs.AI, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: While the success of large language models (LLMs) increases demand for machine-generated text, current pay-per-token pricing schemes create a misalignment of incentives known in economics as moral hazard: Text-generating agents have strong incentive to cut costs by preferring a cheaper model over the cutting-edge one, and this can be done "behind the scenes" since the agent performs inference internally. In this work, we approach this issue from an economic perspective, by proposing a pay-for-performance, contract-based framework for incentivizing quality.

AUTHORS: YIQUN CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.IR [cs.IR, cs.CL]

To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel documents ranking method called TourRank, which is inspired by the tournament mechanism.

166, TITLE: Text Grafting: Near-Distribution Weak Supervision for Minority Classes in Text Classification
AUTHORS: Letian Peng ; Yi Gu ; Chengyu Dong ; Zihan Wang ; Jingbo Shang

HIGHLIGHT: Recent works have started to generate the relevant texts by prompting LLMs using the class names or definitions; however, there is a high risk that LLMs cannot generate in-distribution (i.e., similar to the corpus where the text classifier will be applied) data, leading to ungeneralizable classifiers. In this paper, we combine the advantages of these two approaches and propose to bridge the gap via a novel framework, \emph{text grafting}, which aims to obtain clean and near-distribution weak supervision for minority classes.
