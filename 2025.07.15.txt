AUTHORS: SEUNGWOO KIM et. al.

These properties are uniquelypresent in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure thatinjects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model onestep, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed andunperturbed predictive distributions.
