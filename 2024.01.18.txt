2, TITLE: The Effect of Intrinsic Dataset Properties on Generalization: Unraveling Learning Differences Between Natural and Medical Images
AUTHORS: Nicholas Konz ; Maciej A. Mazurowski
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.IV, stat.ML]
HIGHLIGHT: Yet, the steepness of this relationship varies significantly between medical (radiological) and natural imaging domains, with no existing theoretical explanation. We address this gap in knowledge by establishing and empirically validating a generalization scaling law with respect to $d_{data}$, and propose that the substantial scaling discrepancy between the two considered domains may be at least partially attributed to the higher intrinsic "label sharpness" ($K_F$) of medical imaging datasets, a metric which we propose.

CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.RO]
HIGHLIGHT: In comparison to recent advancements in the 2D domain, grounding language in 3D scenes faces several significant challenges: (i) the inherent complexity of 3D scenes due to the diverse object configurations, their rich attributes, and intricate relationships; (ii) the scarcity of paired 3D vision-language data to support grounded learning; and (iii) the absence of a unified learning framework to distill knowledge from grounded 3D data.

To address this issue, we propose a novel solution to tight visual-inertial fusion directly at the level of first-order kinematics by employing a dynamic vision sensor instead of a normal camera.
