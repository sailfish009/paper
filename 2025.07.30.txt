CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a method togenerate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual andenvironmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenginglearning scenarios.

229, TITLE: On Explaining Visual Captioning with Hybrid Markov Logic Networks
AUTHORS: Monika Shah ; Somdeb Sarkhel ; Deepak Venugopal
CATEGORY: cs.CV [cs.CV, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that iseasily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a languagethat can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where wehypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influencedthe generation of the observed caption.

230, TITLE: PRISM: Programmatic Reasoning with Image Sequence Manipulation for LVLM Jailbreaking
AUTHORS: QUANCHEN ZOU et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.CR [cs.CR, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, wepropose a novel and effective jailbreak framework inspired by Return-OrientedProgramming (ROP) techniques from software security.

231, TITLE: GUARD-CAN: Graph-Understanding and Recurrent Architecture for CAN Anomaly Detection
AUTHORS: Hyeong Seon Kim ; Huy Kang Kim
CATEGORY: cs.CR [cs.CR, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Modern in-vehicle networks face various cyber threats due to the lack ofencryption and authentication in the Controller Area Network (CAN). To addressthis security issue, this paper presents GUARD-CAN, an anomaly detectionframework that combines graph-based representation learning with time-seriesmodeling.

232, TITLE: Hierarchical Graph Neural Network for Compressed Speech Steganalysis
AUTHORS: Mustapha Hemis ; Hamza Kheddar ; Mohamed Chahine Ghanem ; Bachir Boudraa
CATEGORY: cs.CR [cs.CR, cs.AI, cs.SD, eess.AS]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper presents the first application of a Graph NeuralNetwork (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis ofcompressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams.

233, TITLE: Verification Cost Asymmetry in Cognitive Warfare: A Complexity-Theoretic Framework
AUTHORS: Joshua Luberisse
CATEGORY: cs.CR [cs.CR, cs.CC, cs.CY, cs.GT, F.0; H.0]
HIGHLIGHT: We introduce the Verification Cost Asymmetry (VCA)coefficient, formalizing it as the ratio of expected verification work betweenpopulations under identical claim distributions.

234, TITLE: Learning Simulatable Models of Cloth with Spatially-varying Constitutive Properties
AUTHORS: GUANXIONG CHEN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.GR [cs.GR, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Worse, suchmethods can suffer from numerical artifacts called ``membrane locking'' thatmakes cloth appear artificially stiff. Here we propose a general framework,called Mass-Spring Net, for learning a simple yet efficient surrogate modelthat captures the effects of these complex materials using only motionobservations.

235, TITLE: Teach Me to Trick: Exploring Adversarial Transferability Via Knowledge Distillation
AUTHORS: Siddhartha Pradhan ; Shikshya Shiwakoti ; Neha Bathuri
CATEGORY: cs.LG [cs.LG, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: We investigate whether knowledge distillation (KD) from multipleheterogeneous teacher models can enhance the generation of transferableadversarial examples.

237, TITLE: Reservoir Computation with Networks of Differentiating Neuron Ring Oscillators
AUTHORS: ALEXANDER YEUNG et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Here, we introduce a smallworld graph of differentiating neurons that are active only when there arechanges in input as an alternative to integrating neurons as a reservoircomputing substrate.

238, TITLE: Hebbian Memory-Augmented Recurrent Networks: Engram Neurons in Deep Learning
AUTHORS: Daniel Szelogowski
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI, cs.IR, cs.LG, q-bio.NC, I.2.0; I.2.4; I.2.6; I.2.m; E.1; E.2; E.4; H.3; J.3; J.4]

239, TITLE: Fixed-Point-Oriented Programming: A Concise and Elegant Paradigm
AUTHORS: Yong Qi Foo ; Brian Sze-Kai Cheong ; Michael D. Adams
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: For example, the graph distance problem can beexpressed in only two executable lines of code with FPOP, while it takes anorder of magnitude more code in other paradigms. By bridging the gap betweentheoretical fixed-point formulations and practical implementations, we aim tofoster further research and adoption of this paradigm.

240, TITLE: Decision Transformer-Based Drone Trajectory Planning with Dynamic Safety-Efficiency Trade-Offs
AUTHORS: Chang-Hun Ji ; SiWoon Song ; Youn-Hee Han ; SungTae Moon
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners areadaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address thesafety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce aDecision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a singleparameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamicallyadjust the safety-efficiency trade-off.

241, TITLE: Can Large Language Models Assist Choice Modelling? Insights Into Prompting Strategies and Current Models Capabilities
AUTHORS: Georges Sfeir ; Gabriel Nova ; Stephane Hess ; Sander van Cranenburgh
CATEGORY: econ.EM [econ.EM, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to support various workflowsacross different disciplines, yet their potential in choice modelling remainsrelatively unexplored.
