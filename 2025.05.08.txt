This arises from the random positioning of knowledge components within prompts, where irrelevant component fusion introduces interference.To address this, we propose Componential Prompt-Knowledge Alignment (KA-Prompt), a novel prompt-based DIL method that introduces component-aware prompt-knowledge alignment during training, significantly improving both the learning and inference capacity of the model.

AUTHORS: ZHENGHAO XING et. al.
CATEGORY: eess.AS [eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.MM, cs.SD]
HIGHLIGHT: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced perception across text, vision, and audio, yet they often struggle with structured cross-modal reasoning, particularly when integrating audio and visual signals. We introduce EchoInk-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances such reasoning in MLLMs.

159, TITLE: 3D Brain MRI Classification for Alzheimer Diagnosis Using CNN with Data Augmentation
AUTHORS: Thien Nhan Vo ; Bac Nam Ho ; Thanh Xuan Truong
CATEGORY: eess.IV [eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG]
HIGHLIGHT: Using stochastic noise injection and five-fold cross-validation, the model achieved test set accuracy of 0.912 and area under the ROC curve of 0.961, an improvement of approximately 0.027 over resizing alone.
