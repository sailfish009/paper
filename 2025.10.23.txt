Existing methodstypically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deepneural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy acrossmodalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines alow-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexiblemultimodal survival prediction.

244, TITLE: Pragmatic Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception Via Generative Communication Mechanism
AUTHORS: Junfei Zhou; Penglin Dai; Quanmin Wei; Bingyi Liu; Xiao Wu; Jianping Wang
CATEGORY: arxiv-cs.CV [CV]
HIGHLIGHT: However, in real-world applications,differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably leadto domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptationand reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due totwo key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modulesdisrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communicationmechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneousmulti-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the originalnetwork, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information toefficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost.
