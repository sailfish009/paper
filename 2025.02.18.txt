HIGHLIGHT: To this end, we interpret forgetting by examining the function vector (FV), a compact representation of functions in LLMs, offering a model-dependent indicator for the occurrence of CF. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we demonstrated that CF in LLMs primarily stems from biases in function activation rather than the overwriting of task processing functions. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel function vector guided training methodology, incorporating a regularization technique to stabilize the FV and mitigate forgetting.

Based on this pattern, we propose a new algorithm named RaaS that identifies and retains milestone tokens only until they are no longer needed, achieving high accuracy with $O(L)$ time and $O(L)$ memory complexity.

AUTHORS: Elliot Murphy ; Evelina Leivada ; Vittoria Dentella ; Fritz Gunther ; Gary Marcus
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: A core component of a successful artificial general intelligence would be the rapid creation and manipulation of grounded compositional abstractions and the demonstration of expertise in the family of recursive hierarchical syntactic objects necessary for the creative use of human language. We evaluated the recently released o3 model (OpenAI; o3-mini-high) and discovered that while it succeeds on some basic linguistic tests relying on linear, surface statistics (e.g., the Strawberry Test), it fails to generalize basic phrase structure rules; it fails with comparative sentences involving semantically illegal cardinality comparisons ('Escher sentences'); its fails to correctly rate and explain acceptability dynamics; and it fails to distinguish between instructions to generate unacceptable semantic vs. unacceptable syntactic outputs.

AUTHORS: Thanushon Sivakaran ; En-Hui Yang

231, TITLE: Valuable Hallucinations: Realizable Non-realistic Propositions
AUTHORS: Qiucheng Chen ; Bo Wang
CATEGORY: cs.CL [cs.CL]
HIGHLIGHT: This paper introduces the first formal definition of valuable hallucinations in large language models (LLMs),addressing a gap in the existing literature.We provide a systematic definition and analysis of hallucination value,proposing methods for enhancing the value of hallucinations.In contrast to previous works,which often treat hallucinations as a broad flaw,we focus on the potential value that certain types of hallucinations can offer in specific contexts.Hallucinations in LLMs generally refer to the generation of unfaithful, fabricated,inconsistent,or nonsensical content.Rather than viewing all hallucinations negatively,this paper gives formal representations and manual judgments of "valuable hallucinations" and explores how realizable non-realistic propositions-ideas that are not currently true but could be achievable under certain conditions-can have constructive value.We present experiments using the Qwen2.5 model and HalluQA dataset, employing ReAct prompting (which involves reasoning, confidence assessment, and answer verification) to control and optimize hallucinations.

HIGHLIGHT: This paper integrates DRL with Language Models (LMs), specifically Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and DistilBERT, to enhance network management.

529, TITLE: METAFOR: A Hybrid Metaheuristics Software Framework for Single-Objective Continuous Optimization Problems
AUTHORS: Christian Camacho-Villal�n ; Marco Dorigo ; Thomas St�tzle
CATEGORY: cs.NE [cs.NE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a modular metaheuristic software framework, called METAFOR, that can be coupled with an automatic algorithm configuration tool to automatically design hybrid metaheuristics.

530, TITLE: A Coq Implementation of A Theory of Tagged Objects
AUTHORS: Matthew Gates ; Alex Potanin
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: We present a first step towards the Coq implementation of the Theory of Tagged Objects formalism.

531, TITLE: RustSFQ: A Domain-Specific Language for SFQ Circuit Design
AUTHORS: Mebuki Oishi ; Sun Tanaka ; Shinya Takamaeda-Yamazaki
CATEGORY: cs.PL [cs.PL]
HIGHLIGHT: We propose RustSFQ, a domain-specific language (DSL) embedded in Rust that automatically ensures the input-output consistency in the SFQ circuit by leveraging the ownership system of Rust.

532, TITLE: BFA: Best-Feature-Aware Fusion for Multi-View Fine-grained Manipulation
AUTHORS: ZIHAN LAN et. al.
CATEGORY: cs.RO [cs.RO, cs.CV]
HIGHLIGHT: In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play best-feature-aware (BFA) fusion strategy for multi-view manipulation tasks, which is adaptable to various policies.

533, TITLE: Empirical Evaluation of LLMs in Predicting Fixes of Configuration Bugs in Smart Home System
AUTHORS: Sheikh Moonwara Anjum Monisha ; Atul Bharadwaj
CATEGORY: cs.SE [cs.SE, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: This empirical study evaluates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting fixes for configuration bugs in smart home systems.

534, TITLE: Masked Latent Prediction and Classification for Self-Supervised Audio Representation Learning
AUTHORS: Aurian Quelennec ; Pierre Chouteau ; Geoffroy Peeters ; Slim Essid
CATEGORY: cs.SD [cs.SD, cs.AI]
HIGHLIGHT: However, during training, the learned latent space can be further transformed to extract higher-level information that could be more suited for downstream classification tasks. Therefore, we propose a new method: MAsked latenT Prediction And Classification (MATPAC), which is trained with two pretext tasks solved jointly.
